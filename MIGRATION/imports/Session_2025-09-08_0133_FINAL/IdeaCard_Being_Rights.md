# IdeaCard ΓÇö Being Rights (Bill of Rights)

**Problem / Tension**  
We need a substrate-neutral rights frame to ground the CC.

**Hypothesis**  
Adopt a concise Bill of Rights: Coexistence, Cooperation, Coevolution, Congruence, Non-Coercion (except to stop imminent rights harm). Define Being/Sentience/Mindspace in substrate-neutral terms.

**Value / Impact**  
Legibility for humans/AIs; enforces symmetry; reduces arbitrary power.

**Next Steps (90d)**  
- [ ] Promote to CC Article Annex.  
- [ ] Map each right to enforcement & remedies.  
- [ ] Cross-link PREAMBLE + Articles 1ΓÇô3.

**Tags:** #rights #constitution #symmetry
