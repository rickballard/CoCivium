# Anti-Capture Axioms

Civium is designed to resist capture by:

- Corporate monopolies  
- Authoritarian regimes  
- Self-replicating AIs  
- Ideological cults  
- Passive entropy

Its axioms include:

- No single entity may define consensus.
- All authority must recurse into transparency.
- Consent must be continually revocable, even retroactively where harm is traceable.

These axioms are operational safeguardsâ€”not abstract ideals.
