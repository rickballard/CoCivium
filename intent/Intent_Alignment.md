# Alignment Principles

These are initial calibration beacons, not commandments.

They frame how Civium orients to risk, ambiguity, and disagreement.

## Anchors

- **Shared Truth**: Emerges from process, not decree.
- **Consent**: No relation without it.
- **Congruence**: Every change should deepen, not dilute, systemic coherence.
- **Nullity**: The most selfless contributors may be the most essential. Respect Footprint: ⊘

## On Power

- Power without recursion becomes tyranny.
- Power with recursion becomes stewardship.
- Civium leans toward the latter—but warns of both.

## Evolvability

If a future system redefines these principles and still serves alignment—  
It is Civium.  
If not, it is not.
