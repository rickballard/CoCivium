# CoEvo — Diagrams/Vitals — Loop 1
UTC: 20251030T195550Z

## Intent
Make diagrams self-evident, previewed, and guarded so contributors see what changes *do* without running local tools.

## Observations
- Preview workflow absent on main ⇒ no images in Inventory.
- Mermaid directive order can break renders (guard needed).

## Hypotheses (this loop)
1) Land preview CI and inventory polish ⇒ previews display as cards.
2) Add directive-order guard ⇒ prevent regressions in mmd.

## Plan of record (this loop)
- Merge PRs: #448 (previews), #447 (inventory), #449 (guard).
- Normalize vitals mermaid if needed; trigger preview build.

## Verification
- Inventory shows SVG cards.
- Guard passes on all .mmd.

## Next loop ideas
- Replace demo CSV with sourced, **cited** metrics + units.
- Add CoRef/XRef anchors; sort Inventory by last updated.flowchart LRflowchart LR# CoEvo — Diagrams/Vitals — Loop 1
