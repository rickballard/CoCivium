# CoEthics Integrity Map — Strategic Advisory Addendum  
*For an existing CoEthics dev session with roadmap already in motion*  

**Intent of this file**  
This document is designed as an **advisory addendum**, not a replacement for the current CoEthics roadmap. It offers:  

- A clearer framing of **problem / opportunity**  
- Strategic **user & impact lenses**  
- A scan of **adjacent / competitive spaces** and lessons from them  
- **Best-practice design principles** to avoid known pitfalls (greenwashing, opaque ratings, partisan capture)  
- A **menu of roadmap-enhancing options** (MVP-safe, Phase 2+, and “moonshot”)  

The active CoEthics session can selectively adopt, adapt, or ignore pieces of this addendum depending on its current priorities and constraints.  

---

## 1. Problem & Opportunity

### 1.1 Problem

Citizens today face three intertwined challenges:

1. **Opacity of influence**  
   - It’s hard to see how media outlets, commercial brands, civic orgs, and platforms shape public narratives and behaviours.  
   - Political and economic influence flows (lobbying, funding, attention, data extraction) are fragmented across many sources and formats.  

2. **Fragmented ethical guidance**  
   - Media literacy tools, ESG ratings, and ethical consumer apps tend to focus on *one slice* only (e.g., news bias, climate, fashion, political donations).  
   - Methods are often opaque, paywalled, or narrowly scoped; citizens must stitch together multiple tools to form a picture.  

3. **Static and fragile mental models**  
   - People see “good vs bad” brands as static categories, even though organisations change over time (sometimes significantly).  
   - There is little support for understanding *direction of travel* or integrity gaps between claim and behaviour.  

### 1.2 Opportunity

CoEthics can create a **CoCivium-native Integrity Map** that:

- Unifies **media, commerce, civic actors, and platforms** in a single ethical visibility layer.  
- Focuses on **behaviour over time** rather than one-off labels.  
- Provides **transparent, open methodology**, explicitly publishable and auditable.  
- Becomes a **public-good reference point** that other tools, researchers, and campaigns can build on.  
- Channels attention back to **CoCivium** as a hub for next-generation civic infrastructure.  

---

## 2. Users & Use Cases (Strategic Targeting)

### 2.1 Primary Users

1. **Citizens / general public**  
   - Want to know: “If I watch/buy from X, what am I implicitly supporting?”  
   - Use case: Compare a few outlets and brands before subscribing or buying.  

2. **Educators / schools / civic programs**  
   - Want teaching tools that make media, influence, and capitalism visible.  
   - Use case: Classroom activity where students trace attention and money flows over a week.  

3. **Journalists / analysts / researchers**  
   - Want methodologically sound, machine-readable context they can embed in stories and reports.  
   - Use case: Pull longitudinal views of a company’s “intent vs impact” trajectory around a key event.  

4. **NGOs / advocacy groups**  
   - Want a neutral, externally-managed map they can refer to when campaigning on labour, climate, democracy, privacy, etc.  
   - Use case: Use a specific ethics theme view (e.g., climate) to highlight patterns and call for reforms.  

### 2.2 Secondary Users

- **Regulators / policy makers** — looking for patterns and concentration of power / risk.  
- **Ethical investors / donors** — cross-reference with existing ESG or impact frameworks.  
- **Designers / product teams** — explore external perception and impact to guide product and policy decisions.  

The existing dev session can prioritise which of these to serve first; the default assumption for MVP remains **“curious citizen + educator”**.  

---

## 3. Adjacent Landscape & Lessons (High-Level)

The Integrity Map plays in a space where several categories already exist:

- **Media bias / reliability charts**  
  - Common patterns: two-axis bias vs reliability charts; focus on US politics; mixed reception depending on transparency and perceived neutrality.  
  - Lessons: make methodology and limitations clear; avoid the pretence of a single “correct” rating; explain that ratings are **a lens**, not an oracle.  

- **Ethical consumer apps and directories**  
  - Common patterns: brand ratings on environment, labour, animal welfare, etc.; sector-specific focus (e.g., fashion); mobile-first UX.  
  - Lessons: users respond well to **simple, actionable scores and alternatives**, *if* the methodology is accessible; there is appetite for “better choices at point-of-decision.”  

- **ESG ratings, impact indices, and corporate accountability tools**  
  - Common patterns: institutional focus; large coverage; often opaque or inconsistent methodologies; risk of greenwashing or over-simplification.  
  - Lessons: avoid “black box” scoring; emphasise data sources, uncertainty, and disagreements; complement rather than compete with institutional ESG ratings.  

- **Civic-tech transparency tools (lobbying, campaign finance, etc.)**  
  - Common patterns: government and corporate disclosure visualised for the public; strong open-data ethos.  
  - Lessons: provide **exportable, open formats**; align with open-data communities and academic partners; ensure that the map plays well with existing datasets rather than trying to replace them.  

### 3.1 Differentiation for CoEthics

CoEthics can differentiate by:

- **Unifying multiple domains** (media + commerce + civic + platforms) in one ontology.  
- Focusing on **direction of travel** (trajectories) rather than static scores.  
- Providing **multiple stakeholder lenses and ethics themes**, not just “left vs right” or “good vs bad”.  
- Being fully **transparent, open-source, and CoCivium-governed**, similar to a civic utility.  

The Integrity Map is best framed as:  

> a *foundational civic layer* that other tools and movements can plug into,  
> not a competitor to every existing rating or chart.

## 4. Strategic Objectives & KPIs (Advisory)

The dev session can decide whether to adopt these, but they are recommended anchors.

### 4.1 Strategic Objectives (12–24 months)

1. Become a **referenced public resource** in media literacy / ethics conversations.  
2. Support **CoCivium’s articulation** as a serious civic-tech hub with at least one widely recognised public asset.  
3. Provide **machine-readable outputs** that external researchers and tools can integrate.  
4. Integrate the Integrity Map meaningfully into at least **2–3 CoSuite products** (e.g., CoAudit, CoAgent/CoArena, CoPolitic).  

### 4.2 Example KPIs

- # of entities mapped and kept fresh over time  
- # of monthly users (for any public viewer)  
- # of external references (articles, talks, syllabi, reports)  
- # of external integrations (NGOs, civic-tech tools, researchers)  
- # of CoSuite products using the map as an input  
- Volume and quality of **feedback / corrections** (indicating engagement)

## 5. Design Principles & Best Practices

Based on global experience with media charts, ESG ratings, ethical consumer tools, and civic-tech platforms, suggested design principles include:

1. **Radical transparency of method**  
   - Publish data sources, scoring rules, update cadence, and known limitations.  
   - Version and log changes to methodology.  

2. **Behaviour-first, not branding-first**  
   - Focus on observable actions (policies, outputs, disclosures, patterns) rather than reputation narratives.  

3. **Pluralism and multiple lenses**  
   - Support several view modes and axes without forcing a single moral hierarchy.  
   - Make stakeholder lenses (citizen, worker, investor, regulator, etc.) explicit.  

4. **Participatory input, but curated**  
   - Allow signals or feedback from users and partners, but with moderation and clear rules.  
   - Avoid turning the map into a raw popularity contest or partisan battleground.  

5. **No “one magic score”**  
   - Single composite scores are tempting but can hide complexity and create false certainty.  
   - Prefer multi-axis radar-like views and clear narrative summaries.  

6. **Show uncertainty and data gaps**  
   - Empty or low-confidence areas should be visibly different from “bad” performance.  
   - Encourage data improvements and disclosure, not just punishment.  

7. **Guard against greenwashing and capture**  
   - Avoid pay-to-improve or pay-for-rating patterns.  
   - Make it impossible for any single stakeholder group to quietly bias the methodology.  

8. **Ethics by design in UX**  
   - Avoid outrage bait or “hall-of-shame” UI that encourages pile-ons.  
   - Use framing and visual design that promotes reflection, context, and future improvement.  

The existing roadmap can treat this section as a **checklist** when evaluating features.

## 6. Product Concept Recap (For Alignment)

This section is a minimal recap, meant only to align with the main Integrity Map spec (not to override it).

- **Core object**: a graph of entities (media outlets, brands, civic orgs, platforms, etc.)  
- **Ontology**: shared axes (transparency, integrity, labour, environment, privacy & AI, democracy/info, community, business model, governance)  
- **Signals**: public data and observed behaviours over time  
- **Outputs**:  
  - Longitudinal scores on each axis  
  - Direction-of-travel vectors  
  - View-mode filtered maps and charts  
  - Machine-readable exports (JSON, CSV, etc.)  

View modes (domain, stakeholder, ethics theme, time horizon, intent vs impact, etc.) act as **projection layers** on this core graph.  

---

## 7. Governance & Oversight (Advisory)

Recommendations (the dev session can down-scope as needed):  

1. **Repo of record**  
   - Designate a single CoEthics (or CoCivium) repo as source of truth for ontology, methodology, and data pipeline definitions.  

2. **Steward roles**  
   - *Product Steward* — responsible for roadmap and community interface.  
   - *Methodology & Data Steward* — responsible for ontology, sources, and scoring rules.  
   - *Ethics / Harm Review Steward* — responsible for handling complaints, edge cases, and escalation.  

3. **Advisory circle**  
   - A small, rotating group from relevant domains (e.g., media literacy, ethics, civic tech, labour/enviro justice, governance).  
   - Reviews major changes in methodology or user-facing positioning.  

4. **Dispute & opt-out process**  
   - Clear public page and simple contact path.  
   - Treat disputes as data: record, respond, and, where appropriate, feed learnings back into methodology.

## 8. Risks & Mitigations (Guide for Future Decisions)

| Risk | Description | Advisory Mitigation |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| Defamation / reputational harm | Entities may object to how they are depicted. | Behaviour-only inputs; transparent methods; neutral language; clear dispute process. |
| Perceived political / ideological bias | Stakeholders may assume the map is aligned with one “side”. | Multi-stakeholder advisory; explicit plurality of lenses; open sourcing of methodology; no single axis dominates. |
| Greenwashing / ethics-washing | Entities could use improved ratings for PR without substantive change. | Require sustained patterns over time; highlight *direction of travel* and past patterns; avoid paid influence. |
| Data quality / coverage gaps | Incomplete or inconsistent data, especially outside large economies. | Surface uncertainty; highlight areas with poor data as a civic gap; partner with researchers/NGOs to improve. |
| Misuse (e.g., harassment, pile-ons) | Map snapshots could be weaponised online. | Avoid “hall-of-shame” UI; emphasise context; include responsible-use messaging; avoid gamified “worst offender” lists. |
| Scope creep & complexity | Too many lenses and features could stall progress. | Maintain a small, explicit MVP; use phased roadmap with gates; treat new lenses as experiments. |

## 9. Roadmap Integration — Menu of Enhancements

This section is intended as a **menu of options** the current dev session can selectively add to its roadmap, rather than strict instructions.

### 9.1 MVP-safe Enhancements (Low–Medium Effort)

- Add a brief **Problem & Opportunity** section to existing docs.  
- Explicitly declare **primary target users** for MVP (e.g., citizens + educators).  
- Publish an initial **methodology overview** page (even if simplified).  
- Highlight **uncertainty / data gaps** in visuals (e.g., a “low data” shading).  
- Define and communicate a **Minimum Ethics Principle Set** (e.g., no pay-to-improve ratings).  

### 9.2 Phase 2+ Enhancements (Moderate Effort)

- Implement at least **two stakeholder lenses** (Citizen, Worker) in the UI.  
- Add **Intent vs Impact** view (stated pledges vs observed behaviour).  
- Integrate with at least one **external dataset** (e.g., a public lobbying or environmental disclosure source).  
- Provide **API or data exports** for researchers and civic-tech collaborators.  
- Establish a small, informal **advisory circle** and schedule periodic methodology reviews.  

### 9.3 “Moonshot” Enhancements (Longer-Term)

- Build a **participatory input layer** where vetted contributors can submit signals or annotations.  
- Provide **personalised ethics profiles** where users can express what they care about most and see customised views.  
- Co-develop **curricula and teaching kits** with educators, using the Integrity Map as a core visual.  
- Partner with multiple civic-tech and accountability actors to establish a **de facto open standard** for behaviour-based ethics mapping.  

The dev session can tag chosen items in its own roadmap as “from CoEthics Advisory Addendum” to keep provenance clear.  

---

## 10. MVP Slice (Refined Suggestion)

As an advisory, a practical MVP target might remain:

- ~20 entities (10 media, 10 commerce)  
- 1 public view mode: **Citizen / Media+Commerce / Democracy & Information lens**  
- Axes implemented:  
  - Transparency  
  - Narrative/Product Integrity  
  - Labour Responsibility  
  - Democracy & Information Integrity  

Outputs:

- Static SVG map (plus image for README)  
- JSON export of entity positions and trajectories  
- Short “How to read this map” explainer text  

Everything else in this addendum can be layered on via the roadmap as capacity allows.  

---

## 11. CoCivium Flywheel Story (Strategic Framing)

To keep the CoEthics work anchored in the broader CoCivium mission, a simple flywheel narrative is recommended:

1. **Integrity Map launches** as a public good, even in a small MVP form.  
2. This draws **citizens, educators, and analysts** who need understandable, transparent context.  
3. Their attention exposes them to **CoCivium and the broader CoSuite** (CoAudit, CoPolitic, CoAgent/CoArena, etc.).  
4. Usage and feedback improve the **quality and relevance** of the map and metrics.  
5. Improved metrics attract **partners and funders** who want better governance and accountability tools.  
6. New partnerships and resources enable CoCivium to **grow its infrastructure and standards**, reinforcing the Integrity Map and spawning new civic tools.  

The Integrity Map is thus not only a product; it is a **strategic anchor** and gateway into CoCivium.  

---

## 12. Short Narrative Snippet for Comms

A reusable blurb for landing pages, repos, and outreach:

> **CoEthics is building an open, evolving Integrity Map of how media, brands, and institutions behave over time.**  
> It doesn’t tell you what to think; it simply makes behaviour visible, so people can align what they watch and buy with what they believe.  
> Hosted within CoCivium, it is designed as a public good that anyone can inspect, critique, and build upon.  

---

## 13. How to Use This Addendum

- Treat this file as **optional, advisory input** to the existing roadmap.  
- Copy or adapt sections that are helpful (e.g., design principles, risk table, MVP slice).  
- Defer, modify, or discard pieces that conflict with current constraints or decisions.  
- When incorporating ideas, consider tagging them in internal docs as:  
  > “Source: CoEthics Integrity Map — Strategic Advisory Addendum”  

This preserves flexibility for the current dev session while still making the best available strategic and global-practice context easily accessible.
