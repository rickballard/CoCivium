# CoSync note - MW fork scheme standard v1

Timestamp: 20251125T234046Z  
Repo: CoCivium  

## Summary

- MegaWave fork numbering standard is live on main:
  - docs/intent/advice/MegaWave_Fork_Scheme_v1.md
  - docs/intent/advice/INDEX_MegaWave_Standards.md

- AcademiaShock auto branches have been reconciled through PR and main is clean.
- Local main and origin/main are now aligned.

## Intent

- Co1 and all future sessions should use the MW fork numbering scheme for new MegaWave countdowns.
- Legacy MegaWave sequences may complete with their existing numbering, but new sequences should follow the forkable scheme.
- Theories, CoIndex, CoSteward and CoPrime sessions can treat the above files as the canonical reference for MegaWave numbering.

## Pointers

- Standard: docs/intent/advice/MegaWave_Fork_Scheme_v1.md
- Index:   docs/intent/advice/INDEX_MegaWave_Standards.md
