# CoSync  -  README layout polish  -  20251103-042147Z

**Scope**
- H2 majors + horizontal rules for section separation.
- Vignette retitled; “Mira” removed; one-line bridge added.
- First-hour list normalized; typos fixed.
- Where next? standardized (quickstart, theory, practice, deep dive).

**Artifact**
- README.md

**Next for CoPrime**
- Keep Express-lane diagrams in sync with \docs/diagrams/*\.
- Optionally add a 3-bullet “Why it matters” sub-block later if we want a slightly richer front door.
