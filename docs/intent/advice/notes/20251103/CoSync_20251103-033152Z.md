# CoSync  -  Front door vignette trim + couplet links  -  20251103-033152Z

**Scope**
- Kept Eli vignette; removed the secondary “Mira” paragraph to reduce drag.
- Tiny wording fixes; restored world-issues couplet links under “Where next?”.

**Artifacts**
- README.md

**Next**
- If we want the legacy acrostic “world-issues chorus” + hero images back, restore them into \docs/insights/world-issues/THEORY.md\ with provenance.
