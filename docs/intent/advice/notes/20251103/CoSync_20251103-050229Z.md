# CoSync — mined README-era assets into living docs — 20251103-050229Z

**Done**
- THEORY seeded from short paras in README history.
- PRACTICE seeded with 2 crisp example block(s).
- BPOE quicklist built from Trust and safety plus canon 10.
- Ops manual stub created with guardrails and runbooks.
- Highlights updated to show THEORY and PRACTICE seeded.

**Pointers**
- docs\insights\world-issues\THEORY.md
- docs\insights\world-issues\PRACTICE.md
- docs\bpoe\quicklist.md
- docs\ops\README.md
- docs\links\HIGHLIGHTS.md

**Next for CoPrime**
- Replace seeded examples with current pilots and receipts.
- Expand BPOE with contributor PRs, keep top 10 short.
- Grow Ops into real runbooks as loops mature.
