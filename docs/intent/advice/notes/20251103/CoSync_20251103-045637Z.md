# CoSync  -  add Highlights guide and README pointer  -  20251103-045637Z

**Done**
- Added bottom pointer in README.md to an evolving navigation guide.
- Created docs/links/HIGHLIGHTS.md with short, human-scannable sections.
- Used planned paths in backticks to avoid dead links until assets land.

**Pointers**
- README.md
- docs/links/HIGHLIGHTS.md

**Next**
- Backfill planned pages: THEORY/PRACTICE expansions, Ops Manual skeleton, BPOE quicklist.
- Consider a simple script to regenerate HIGHLIGHTS from a tags map later.
