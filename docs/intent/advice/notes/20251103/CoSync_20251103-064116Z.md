# CoSync — AI front door portable + world-issues harvest — 20251103-064116Z

**Done**
- Rebuilt FRONT_DOOR.json from .gibx; added GIBX⇄JSON parity comparer to CI.
- Linter runs: Test-Gibx + Compare-GibxJson on PRs.
- Harvested concise reusable paras/blocks from 90b58f7 into THEORY/PRACTICE (no duplicates).

**Pointers**
- docs/ai/FRONT_DOOR.gibx, docs/ai/FRONT_DOOR.json
- .github/workflows/gibx-lint.yml
- tools/Test-Gibx.ps1, tools/Compare-GibxJson.ps1
- docs/insights/world-issues/THEORY.md
- docs/insights/world-issues/PRACTICE.md

**Next**
- Replace any harvested “legacy” example headings with fresh pilot receipts as they land.
- Keep FRONT_DOOR.gibx as the single AI onramp; other AI-facing files should link back.
