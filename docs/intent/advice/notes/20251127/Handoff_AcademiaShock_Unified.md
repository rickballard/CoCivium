# Handoff — Academia Shock → CoIndex Orchestration
UTC: 20251128T011943Z

## What
Unifying the “Academia Shock” effort under **CoIndex**. CoTrove (theories/quotes), CoTheories (formal frames), and the Academia Shock paper in CoCivium now hand off workflows to the **CoIndex** session so AIs can read and write across repos programmatically.

## Why
Academia-facing v1 needs a thick literature spine, formal math, and reproducible evidence. Those depend on:
- **CoTrove** for structured intake of theories, quotes, methods, and data
- **CoIndex** for AI-facing CoPortal entries and cross-repo discovery
- **CoCivium** for the paper scaffold, figures, and refs
- **CoTheories** for definitions, lemmas, and proofs

## Next
- CoIndex: own the orchestration. Track tag cademia-shock. Wire sources to the portal entry.
- CoTrove: add intake items using the schema. Tag each item cademia-shock.
- CoTheories: contribute formal definitions and proofs. Cross-reference CoTrove ids.
- CoCivium: expand v1 with citations from CoTrove and math from CoTheories. Keep efs.bib in sync.

## Outstanding directions (to complete)
- Convert CoTrove items into efs.bib entries and inline citations.
- Add figures for governance equilibria and CiviProof pipeline.
- Define MeritRank update and CiviProof validation pseudocode and tests.
- Pilot plan doc: 90-day department trial with audit suites and metrics.

## Pointer
The CoIndex portal entry should list:
- epo:CoCivium/docs/academia-shock/WhitePaper/AcademicShock_v1.md
- epo:CoCivium/docs/academia-shock/WhitePaper/refs.bib
- epo:CoTrove/docs/INTAKE/items
- (optional) epo:CoTheories/docs/* once present
