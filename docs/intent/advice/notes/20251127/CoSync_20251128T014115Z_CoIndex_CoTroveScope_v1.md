# CoSync note - CoIndex CoTrove scope-drop (advisory)

Timestamp: 20251128T014115Z  
Repo: CoCivium  

## Summary

- A scope-drop memo has been created for the CoIndex repo that proposes:
  - CoIndex owns the CoTrove schema.
  - CoIndex owns CoTrove mining, indexing, and CoPortal preparation.
  - CoTrove is treated as an indexable primitive that lives under CoIndex.

- The memo is advisory only. It is not a binding standard.
- The memo arrived via a Downloads path and must be adopted via normal CoIndex PR flow.

## Location

- CoIndex file (proposed canonical path once committed):
  - CoIndex/docs/CoIndex_ScopeDrop_CoTroveAndMining_v1.md

## Intent

- Co1 and future CoIndex sessions should:
  - Read this memo.
  - Evolve or refactor the advice into formal standards and tools.
  - Wire CoTrove into the CoIndex and CoPortal architectures.

- This session ("Benedict") will terminate once this CoSync note and the CoIndex memo are on repo, with no remaining unsaved wisdom.

## Notes

- The CoTrove scope memo explicitly states:
  - It is advice only.
  - It was initially off-repo in Downloads.
  - CoIndex should decide what to keep, change, or discard.
