# CoSync  -  Front door README polish & linkage verify  -  20251102-212024Z

Scope
- Fixed minor README nits from canvas: bold escapes, typos (“myriad”, “consistently”), phrasing (“safe-to-try pilots / big bets”).
- Verified repo pointers exist: diagrams + quickstart + deep dive.
- Left express-lane structure per current canvas; no structural changes.

Pointers
- PR #456 (docs: front-door README suite)

Next for CoPrime
- Review/merge PR #456 (squash).
- If desired, fold in phrasing from #457 (README history sampler) with SHA attribution.
