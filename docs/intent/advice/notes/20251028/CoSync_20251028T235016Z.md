# CoSync — Diagrams Inventory & Gallery Handoff

**UTC:** {UTCSTAMP}  
**Commit HEAD:** `{HEAD}`

## What changed in this session
- Added **Diagram Inventory** with thumbnails, meta (title/tags), **Description**, **Status (Rendered/Planned)**, and “Discuss” links.
- Seeded backlog of planned diagrams (.mmd + meta stubs).
- Linked gallery from `docs/DIAGRAMS.md`.
- Absolute link index refreshed.

## Pointers
- Inventory: {INV_URL}  
- Gallery landing: {DIAG_URL}  
- Absolute links: {ABS_URL}  
- Exporter workflow (Mermaid → SVG/PNG): {WF_URL}

## Status snapshot
- Total diagrams tracked: **{TOTAL}**
- Rendered (SVG/PNG present): **{RENDERED}**
- Planned (mmd only): **{PLANNED}**

## Next steps for CoPrime
1. Run exporter if needed (Actions → *diagrams-export*), then refresh the Inventory (re-run DO-1 if you want a deterministic rebuild).
2. Open meta files with empty captions and fill **Description** to improve the gallery.
3. Use **Discuss** buttons in the Inventory to gather feedback and track revisions.
4. As new diagrams land, keep meta in `docs/diagrams/meta/` updated; the Inventory will surface captions/tags.
