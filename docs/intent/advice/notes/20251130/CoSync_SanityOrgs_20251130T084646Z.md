# CoSync – Sanity+Orgs & KingMaker wave (20251130T084646Z)

## 1. What this CoSync note covers

This note ties together the **Sanity+Orgs** and **KingMaker Sanity Audit**
work done across:

- InSeed (service offers for boards and org upgrades)
- CoCivium (KingMaker insights couplet)
- Desktop sandbox (Sanity+Orgs session folder)

It is a pointer map for Co1 / CoPrime and future CoStewards.

## 2. InSeed – PRs to review / merge

Repo: \ickballard/InSeed\

1. **CoScend Org Upgrade – offer + Alex narrative**

   - Branch: (see PR)
   - PR: https://github.com/rickballard/InSeed/pull/14

   Contents (from earlier Sanity+Orgs waves):

   - \docs/narratives/CoEvolution_of_Alex_v5.md\
     - Story of Alex moving from legacy engineer title toward
       flow / process steward roles in a CoNeural / CoScend org.
   - \services/briefs/InSeed_CoScend_Org_Upgrade_OfferSheet_v1.md\
     - Offer sheet for CoScend Org Upgrade as an InSeed service line.

2. **Sanity+Orgs Board Review – board-facing outline**

   - Branch: \docs/sanity-orgs-boardreview-20251130T041638Z\
   - PR: https://github.com/rickballard/InSeed/pull/15
   - File:
     - \esources/board-brief/InSeed_SanityPlusOrgs_BoardReview_Outline_v1.md\

   Role:

   - Light, high-candour board review:
     - "Are we still structurally sane for the world we are entering?"
   - Pairs with CoScend Org Upgrade:
     - Sanity+Orgs = low-commitment diagnostic
     - CoScend = deeper structural shift option.

## 3. Desktop sandbox – Sanity+Orgs & KingMaker

Local folder (sandbox, *not* on repo by design):

- \C:\Users\Chris\Desktop\Sanity+Orgs\

Key files:

- \SanityOrgs_SessionPlan_v1.md\
  - Session manifest listing:
    - PR 14 and 15
    - planned org-pattern work (CoNeural, CoScend titles)
    - links to future CoSteward / CoAudit / CoIndex work.

- \KingMaker_SanityAudit_Purpose_v1.md\
  - Explains the **Evilia / Demagogia / KingMaker** sanity-audit frame.
  - Sets objectives:
    - "Uhoh" report (hostile threat grading),
    - "Sabotage" strategy (structural patterns only),
    - combined summary for CoCivium hardening.

- \KingMaker_SanityAudit_AssessmentAndRoleplayNotes_v1.md\
  - Evaluates the role-play mechanics.
  - Lists risks (glamorising authoritarian playbooks, blueprints risk,
    emotional load) and mitigations.
  - Suggests using KingMaker as *one* lens among green/blue/red team cycles.

- \KingMaker_SanityAudit_Couplet_v2.md\
  - In-universe Evilia couplet skeleton:
    - "Uhoh" report,
    - "Sabotage / neutralisation" plan,
    - out-of-character summary and threat table,
    - HP57 flag index for sensitive details.

These sandbox assets are feeding distilled, repo-safe insights into CoCivium.

## 4. CoCivium – KingMaker insights couplet

Repo: \ickballard/CoCivium\

Active KingMaker PR (keep):

- Branch: \docs/insights-kingmaker-20251130T080750Z\
- PR: https://github.com/rickballard/CoCivium/pull/595

Files added:

- \docs/insights/KingMaker_SanityAudit_Theory_v1.md\
- \docs/insights/KingMaker_SanityAudit_Practice_v1.md\

### 4.1 Theory insight (summary)

- Defines **KingMaker** as a recurring red-team / sanity lens.
- Positions it as:
  - truth- and coherence-biased,
  - evaluating CoCivium from a hostile (authoritarian) perspective.
- States that detailed thinking lives in:
  - desktop sandbox files (Sanity+Orgs folder),
  - HP57 vault structures referenced by IDs like \KM-HP57-00x\.
- Keeps public focus on:
  - structural threat patterns,
  - conceptual weaknesses,
  - mitigation categories.

### 4.2 Practice insight (summary)

- Describes **when** to run KingMaker passes:
  - major System.Func`2[System.Text.RegularExpressions.Match,System.String], CoIndex, CoArena, CoAgent waves,
  - CoNeural / CoScend org designs,
  - contributor / steward accords,
  - major external shifts (regulation/platform moves/authoritarian risks).
- Defines a *safe* workflow:
  - Sandbox-only "Uhoh" and "Sabotage" drafts,
  - repo-safe summaries and threat tables,
  - feeding mitigations into CoSteward, CoAudit, CoIndex.
- Sets guardrails:
  - no detailed exploit instructions,
  - always pair dark patterns with blowback/harm analysis,
  - rotate lenses (red/green/blue team),
  - strict HP57 handling of specifics.

## 5. Suggested next steps for Co1 / CoPrime

1. **InSeed**
   - Review and **merge PR 14 and 15** when copy is acceptable.
   - Once merged, link them into:
     - InSeed website pages,
     - InSeed_more sessions,
     - any outreach assets for boards.

2. **CoCivium**
   - Review and **merge PR 595** (KingMaker insights couplet).
   - Add GIBindex entries for:
     - KingMaker Sanity Audit (theory/practice),
     - Sanity+Orgs lens,
     - CoScend Org Upgrade,
     - CoNeural Org / CoCells (when ready).

3. **CoSteward / CoAudit / CoIndex**
   - Use KingMaker threat IDs (e.g. T1–T6, KM-HP57-00x) to:
     - seed CoAudit checks,
     - guide CoSteward protocols for red-teaming,
     - extend CoIndex threat/guardrail taxonomy.

4. **Future Sanity+Orgs waves**
   - Flesh out:
     - CoNeural Org pattern docs,
     - title patterns for process stewards (Alex-type roles),
     - CoScan / broader diagnostic variants if desired.

## 6. CoBloat heartbeat (for this wave)

- CU (conceptual usage): SOFT – New concepts (Sanity+Orgs, KingMaker) but contained.
- PU (process usage): SOFT – Standard DO + PR flows; no MegaZip.
- HU (human load): SOFT – Desktop sandbox used to keep repos clean.
- WT (wait time / drift): SOFT – PRs parked for later review/merge; clearly referenced here.

This note can be used by any future session as the entry point back into
the Sanity+Orgs and KingMaker work.
