# Academia Shock  -  Session Plan

**Purpose.** Hold the working MegaWaves plan and the session’s intent checklists; link PRs, dashboards, and bus notes. Repo is source of truth.

## MegaWaves (current)
- **MW1  -  Seed the Paper** → PR: #561
- **MW2  -  Academic Upgrade** → PR: #563
- **MW3  -  Figures + Teaser** → PRs: CoCivium #565, RickPublic #25
- **MW4  -  Parable + CTA** → PRs: CoCivium #566, RickPublic #26
- **MW5  -  Figures wired + refs expansion** → PR: #574
- **MW6  -  Replication harness + receipts** → PR: #577
- **MW6.1  -  CI receipts validation** → PR: #579
- **Next**: MW7 Venue Pack + OSF/SSRN; MW8 Outreach & Metrics.

## Intent Checklist (working)
- [ ] Keep **paper.md** synced with FIGURES.md anchors and captions.
- [ ] Lift refs to 25–35 with exact [n] wiring (MW5 tail).
- [ ] Seed/extend **REPLICATION.md**; receipts schema + demo harness (MW6).
- [ ] CI: validate receipts; upload artifact (MW6.1).
- [ ] Venue pack (CACM Viewpoint bundle) + public supplement (MW7).
- [ ] One-pager + prompts + metrics pointers (MW8).

## Links
- **Countdown (daily):** docs/intent/advice/notes/<YYYYMMDD>/AcademiaShock_Countdown.md
- **CoSync bus (orchestration notes):** docs/intent/advice/bus/<YYYYMMDD>/Bus_<UTCSTAMP>.md
- **Open PRs (live):** see Countdown “Live PRs” sections.

## CoBloat heartbeat
CU=OK, PU=OK, HU=OK, WT=OK

## Rationale (short)
- We’re packaging a public, scholarly Viewpoint that’s **useful** (replication + receipts) and **interesting** (mythos + figures) without feeling promotional. CoCivium links support replication; external/peer sources dominate refs. Countdown + bus keep humans oriented; receipts + CI keep machines honest.
