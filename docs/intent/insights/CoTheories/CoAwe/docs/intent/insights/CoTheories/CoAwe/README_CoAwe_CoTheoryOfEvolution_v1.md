# CoAwe – Insights Folder Couplet (CoTheories / CoEvo)

This folder holds the **canonical CoCivium articulation of CoAwe** as part of the Co-Theory of Evolution.

- `theory/CoAwe_CoTheoryOfEvolution_Theory_v1.md` – conceptual definition and relationships.
- `practice/CoAwe_CoTheoryOfEvolution_Practice_v1.md` – usage patterns, checklists, and case-study stubs.

Stewards may:
- Update these files as experiments accumulate.
- Add additional subfolders (e.g., `cases/`) linking real-world uses of CoAwe.
- Cross-link to GIBindex and other CoTerms (CoHope, CoSoul, CoAura, CoAether, CoEvo, etc.).

This is the **canonical home** for CoAwe in the CoCivium repo.
