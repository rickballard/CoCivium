This MegaWave initialized or confirmed the following assets:

- \docs\schemas\cometa\CoMeta_GIBindex_Staging_v1.md

Intent:
- Create a single staging table for CoMeta-related CoTerms that must be reflected in GIBindex and CoGibber.
- Mark which terms are CoCivium-specific inventions vs broader concepts.
- Seed suggested GIBindex keys and CoGibber hints for later refinement.

Next steps (suggested):
- Extend the table with additional CoMeta-related CoTerms as they emerge.
- In a dedicated GIBindex session, confirm keys and create/align GIBindex entries.
- In a CoGibber session, define concrete token encodings and relation structures.
