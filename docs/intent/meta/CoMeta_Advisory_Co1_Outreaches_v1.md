# CoMeta Advisory for Co1 and Outreaches (v1)

UTS: 20251204T141008Z  
Session label: CoMeta  
Repo: CoCivium

This note tells Co1 like sessions and Outreaches sessions what CoMeta is, what assets now exist on repo, and how to use them.

---

## 1. What CoMeta is (plain language)

- CoMeta is the shared mind environment of CoCivium.
- It is how humans and AIs:
  - form mental pictures of what CoCivium is,
  - decide what is important, risky, or promising,
  - agree on words, meanings, and norms,
  - tell stories about what we are building and why.

It is not a VR world.  
It is closer to the climate of ideas around CoCivium.

Key related ideas:
- CoPreMeta: world and stack before we interpret it.
- CoThink: process of thinking with CoCivium concepts.
- CoThought: artifacts produced by that thinking.
- CoMeta: how we frame and coordinate all of that together.
- CoMetaMeta: how we design and evolve these frames and practices.
- CoBehaviourMeta: behaviour focused slice of CoMeta plus CoMetaMeta.

  - CoPreMeta, CoMeta, CoSubMeta, CoMetaMeta.
  - How CoThink and CoThought fit in.
  - How CME and CoCivia relate to the meta stack.

### GIBindex and CoGibber staging

- docs/schemas/cometa/CoMeta_GIBindex_Staging_v1.md
  - Staging table for CoMeta related CoTerms:
    - Term
    - Category
    - Scope
    - Status
    - GIBindexKey (planned)
    - CoGibberHint
    - DefinitionShort
    - ExampleRefs
  - This is where GIBindex and CoGibber sessions should look when aligning terms and tokens.

### Manifests

## 3. How Co1 like sessions should use this

For Co1 and similar orchestrator sessions:

1. Treat CoMeta as a required lens when:
   - designing new insight pairs,
   - defining BPOEs and workflows,
   - planning cross repo waves,
   - preparing investor or sponsor outreach.

2. Before inventing new CoWords:
   - Check CoMeta_Terminology_v1.md and CoMeta_ConceptMap_v1.md.
   - If a new term truly is needed, add it first to:
     - the relevant schema file, and
     - CoMeta_GIBindex_Staging_v1.md with a draft row.

3. When touching GIBindex or CoGibber:
   - Read CoMeta_GIBindex_Staging_v1.md first.
   - Confirm or update GIBindexKey and CoGibberHint.
   - Keep example references aligned so that CoAudit can check usage.

4. When evolving BPOEs and workflows:
   - Cross reference:
     - CoMeta_BehaviourAndBPOE_v1.md
     - CoMeta_BehaviourPlaybook_v1.md
   - Add CoMetaSpace tags and CoMeta aware notes into BPOE files.

## 4. How Outreaches like sessions should use this

For Outreaches sessions that talk to investors, partners, and the public:

1. Use the **analogy set** from CoMeta_Theory_Primer_v1.md:
   - City lens
   - Weather lens
   - Garden lens
   - Stage lens

2. When writing public materials:
   - Decide which CoMetaSpace you are writing from
     - for example SponsorOnboarding, CoEthics, CoSuiteOverview.
   - Name it explicitly at least once.
   - Add a transparency footer that:
     - states audience and depth,
     - explains why the asset is voiced the way it is.

3. When preparing explainer assets:
   - Pull narrative cues from CoMeta_CoCiviaNarrative_v1.md.
   - Let CoCivia be the explainer persona where that fits the audience.

4. When noticing confusion:
   - Treat it as a CoMetaState and CoMetaRift signal.
   - Capture at least a short sentence:
     - where the confusion appeared,
     - what words clashed,
     - which lens might have helped.
   - Feed that back into Co1 and CoMeta sessions for CoMetaEvoLoop work.

## 5. Suggested next waves (for whoever picks this up)

- Fill in more of the placeholders in:
  - CoMeta_Theory_Primer_v1.md
  - CoMeta_Practice_Playbook_v1.md
  - CoMeta_CoCiviaNarrative_v1.md

- Add diagrams under docs/schemas/cometa:
  - one for the CoLayers stack,
  - one for CoMetaSpaces and CoMetaScape,
  - one for CoMetaEvoLoop and CoMetaMetaLoop.

- Run a dedicated GIBindex session to:
  - confirm GIBindexKey values in CoMeta_GIBindex_Staging_v1.md,
  - create or update the corresponding GIBindex entries.

- Run a CoGibber session to:
  - design token encodings for the same set of terms,
  - link them back to GIBindex via shared keys.

---

## Transparency footer

Purpose:
- Provide Co1 like sessions and Outreaches sessions with a single pointer into the CoMeta asset family and its intended uses.

Audience:
- Orchestrators, outreach designers, stewards, and AI partners that need a high level map, not the full theory.

Evolution intent:
- Future versions should add:
  - links to concrete case studies where CoMeta improved or failed,
  - references to CoAudit and CoGuard checks for meta health,
  - a short crib sheet for live calls and workshops.
