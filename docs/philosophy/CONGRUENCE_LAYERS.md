# Congruence Layers

## Tier-1: Operational Congruence
Alignment with CoCivium’s principles and mission (consent, reversibility, transparency).
Used for:
- Partner/org intake
- CoFit gatekeeping
- Funding alignment tests

## Tier-2: Deep Pattern Congruence
Alignment with universal ethical or systemic patterns (e.g. reversibility, symmetry, emergence, non-harm).
Used for:
- Design coherence in AI tooling
- Evolving the Civium Ontology
- Foresight / co-evolution scoring

## Why This Matters
CoCivium is not for everyone. It is designed for congruent collaboration that grows trust. These tiers allow us to:
- Vet partners without judgment
- Invite feedback instead of rejection
- Build scalable trust that protects our shared protocols

## Application in CoFit
CoFit uses Tier‑1 congruence to filter usage. We do not allow usage by extractive, deceptive, or coercive organizations — regardless of their revenue.

CoFit may also help model Tier‑2 congruence by tracking objections and reversibility loss.
