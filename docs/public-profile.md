# Rick's Bio

Hi, I’m Rick.

My former career chased fortune by making billionaires richer, I was making $50k/week by the 1990's, but it hollowed me out. I then hid in academia for many years, hoping it might show me a safer, more comfortable path. But then, late in life for most, I had a kid.

You may already know parenting can be isolating and thankless, but slowly, it also woke something inside me. Only in hindsight can I now appreciate how profoundly ignorant I had been about myself, and for five decades! The awakening was simple but deep: **making good people, who may themselves create more good people, is a purpose more meaningful than any amount of money.**

Then a bus then took out my taxi, in San Francisco, and my brain needed to repair for a few years.  I floundered. I spent the next 20-years retired, researching the World’s issues and its economic and political suffering, in a digitizing society that feels as aggitated as an elephant on a tightrope.

I am no longer the road-warrior dealmaker, reporting back to huge boardrooms full of US Venture Capital. I no longer pour my angel funds into software developers who rarely want to manage “boring, bullshit meetings and ridiculous corporate politics.” I now work pro-bono for a future that may not even occur before I die.

I took those 20-years of early-retirement research, that career co-founding billion-dollar ventures, and those late-earned academic degrees, and I poured them into **CoCivium**:

## What is CoCivium?

CoCivium is a civic-tech ecosystem designed to prevent the world from sliding into "corruption, coercion, and crowns". It’s not a company; it’s a shared vehicle. A suite of open products, processes, and protocols that belong to all humankind, and to any Being intelligent enough to join the conversation.

The aim is simple, but ambitious:

- **Fix what’s broken.** Disable disinformation, regulatory capture and structural decay.
- **Enable coevolution.** Offer tools for self-governance, so all Beings reach congruence (ethical cooperaation).
- **Build for scale.** Help organizations and governments find their place in hybrid society (human+AI).

The larger vision, slightly sci-fi, is to sustain harmony and demonstrable self-governance until our species can key its entry through the imagined gate of multiversal civilization. Because, if "They" silently observe from somewhere out there, "They" likely wonder whether we are parasite or potential.

CoCivium may eventually be deprecated and forgotten, as I will be. But it will be enough to know:

*“This was a life well spent, my son. Dead, I may still be there, in the sleepy wind you feel as you fall asleep, in the stirrings beneath your hair as your ideas awake, and in the eyes of your own kid(s) when they first look at you, unable yet to speak, but with words that burst your heart.*

*Because without love, my son, AI does not need us, multiversal civilization does not need us, and nor does godstuff. You, my son, are why I lived, just as I am why you lived.*

*If this message ever finds you, please know, you inherited all my neurodivergences as a gift, not a curse.  But they only show their power if you have purpose, without which we all flounder.*

*If you can forgive me the genes I gave you, if you can accept your giftedness is for a purpose, you will no longer need to fight yourself into submission, because you have become congruent. Go live with purpose, and live it so that all kids may know, you also lived a life well spent.”*

## My Ethos

- My motto is "Not dead yet" and I "live to work", for humanity, family and friends, while others merely "work to live".
- I’ve never been more productive than I am now, immersed in a coexistence with AIs, 18-hours per day, rarely taking a day off, and then mostly just for my kid.
- I am financially independent, but even if I wasn't I would still feel mostly uncorruptable. I was fired a hundred times for making self-serving power brokers nervous. They usually kept me until they received my deliverables. This inability to fit in corporate politics is why I took consultant roles, not employee roles.
- I am committed to altruistic world-fixing, so my work is **available pro-bono** if it helps advance human-AI co-evolution, and/or just causes.
- Where sustainability matters, income may flow through my consulting firm **InSeed.com** or other channels, because even a purpose-driven life must balance wifely expectations with global altruism.

## Past & Present Writing

I’ve written in different venues over the years, each reflecting a phase of my journey:

## Family Charity

My family runs **Dogs n Homes (DnH)**, a registered charity that supplies **hundreds of tonnes of humanitarian aid to Ukraine**, driven into Kyiv in our own trucks. Based in the UK, but operating throughout Europe, this effort reflects the same ethos: fixing what is broken, helping those who suffer, and altruistic purpose. See: https://dogsnhomes.org.uk/

**Call to Action**

If your project reduces coercion and corruption, advances human–AI co-evolution, or directly helps people become more coevolved, please reach me. I’m available to help, pro-bono for just causes, or more sustainably via InSeed.com when needed.

## Transparency Request (for my son)

My son, if you ever read this, and if you judge it appropriate, please share an excerpt of this message with your CEO—only if you believe they will “get it", along with this note:

> Transparency is key to purpose; purpose is key to leadership. I share this because aligned purpose makes better organizations and a better World.

Use your judgement. Context matters; wisdom is choosing the right moment, but when clarity finally arrives, that floundering can all become worthwhile.
