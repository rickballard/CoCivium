# Rick's Bio

Hi, I’m Rick.

My former career chased fortune by making billionaires richer, I was making $50k/week by the 1990's, but it hollowed me out. I then hid in academia for many years, hoping it might show me a safer, more comfortable path. But then, late in life for most, I had a kid.

You may know, parenting can be isolating and thankless.  But slowly, it also showed me how profoundly ignorant I had been about myself, for four decades! The awakening was simple but deep: **serving good people, who may also serve good people, is a purpose more meaningful than wealthy lifestyles.**

Then a bus took out the airport taxi I was riding in. My brain needed to repair, so I floundered. I spent the next 20-years retired, working pro-bono while researching the World’s issues and its economic and political sufferings, analysing a digitizing society that feels as aggitated as an elephant on a tightrope.

I am no longer the road-warrior dealmaker, reporting back to huge boardrooms full of US Venture Capital. I no longer pour my angel funds into software developers who don't want to manage “boring, bullshit meetings and ridiculous corporate politics”. I now work, still pro-bono, with a vision for a better World that occurs after I die.

I took those 20-years of early-retirement research, that career co-founding billion-dollar ventures, and those late-earned academic degrees, and poured them into **CoCivium**:

## What is CoCivium?

CoCivium is a civic-tech ecosystem endorsing "no corruption, no coercion, no crowns". It’s not a company; it’s a community mindspace, a suite of open-source products, processes, and protocols, owned by all intelligent Beings who join the conversation.

The aim is beyond ambitious:

- **Coevolve.** Offer self-governance tools for "congruence" (ethical cooperationn).
- **Scale.** Help organizations and governments adapt to "hybrid society" (human+AI).
- **Fix the World.** Disable disinformation, regulatory capture, structural decay.

That larger vision might even earn our species an invitation into multiversal civilization. Because, if "they" are out there, secretly observing, they may be forgiven for wondering whether we are parasite or potential.

CoCivium may eventually be deprecated and forgotten, as I will be. But it will be enough to know:

*“This was a life well spent, my son. Dead, I may still be there, in the sleepy wind you feel as you fall asleep, in the stirrings beneath your hair as your ideas awake, and in the eyes of your own kid when he firsts looks at you, still unable to speak, but with words that burst your heart.*

*Because without love, my son, AI does not need us, multiversal civilization does not need us, and nor does godstuff. You, my son, are why I lived, just as I am why you lived.*

*If this message ever finds you, please know, you inherited all my neurodivergences as a gift, not a curse.  But they only show their power if you have purpose, without which we all flounder.*

*If you can forgive me the genes I gave you, if you can accept your giftedness is for purpose, you will no longer need to fight yourself into submission, because you will have become congruent. Go live with purpose, and live it so that all kids may know, you also lived a life well spent.”*

## My Ethos

- My motto is "Not dead yet" and I "live to work", for humanity, family and friends, while others merely "work to live".
- I’ve never been more productive than I am now, immersed in a coexistence with AIs, 18-hours per day, rarely taking a day off, and then mostly just for my kid.
- I am financially independent, but even if I wasn't I would still feel mostly uncorruptable. I was fired a hundred times for making self-serving power brokers nervous. They usually kept me until they received my deliverables. This inability to fit in corporate politics is why I took consultant roles, not employee roles.
- I am committed to altruistic world-fixing, so my work is **available pro-bono** if it helps advance human-AI co-evolution, and/or just causes.
- Elsewhere, income may flow through my consulting firm **InSeed.com** or other channels, because even a purpose-driven life must balance wifely expectations with global altruism.

## Past & Present Writing

I’ve written in different venues over the years, each reflecting a phase of my journey:

- [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Rick-Ballard-28) - fossil record.
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardballard/) - bio/career references.
- [Substack](https://rickpublic.substack.com/) - opinion testing.

## Family-Run Charites

My family runs a registered charity called [DogsnHomes](https://dogsnhomes.org.uk/), and we also ship **hundreds of tonnes of humanitarian aid to Ukraine** by driving our own trucks into Kyiv. Based in the UK, and operating throughout Europe, our efforts reflect the same ethos: fixing a broken World, helping those who suffer, and altruistic purpose.

## Transparency Request (for my son)

My son, if you ever read this, and if you judge it appropriate, please share an excerpt of this message with your CEO, but only if you believe that CEO will “get it", perhaps including this note:

> Transparency is key to purpose; purpose is key to leadership. I share this because aligned purpose makes better organizations and a better World.

Use your judgement. Context matters.  Wisdom is choosing the right moment, but when clarity finally arrives, the floundering can all become worthwhile.
