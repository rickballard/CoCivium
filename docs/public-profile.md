# Rick's Bio

Hi, I’m Rick.

My former career chased fortune by making billionaires richer.  I was making U$50k/week by the 1990's, but it hollowed me out. I then hid in academia for many years, hoping it might show me a safer, more comfortable path. Then, very late in life for most, I had a kid.

You may know that parenting can be isolating, and thankless.  But slowly, it can also show you how profoundly ignorant one can be about oneself, and for four decades! The awakening was simple but deep: **serving good people, who may also serve good people, is a purpose more meaningful than wealthy lifestyles.**

Then a bus took out the airport taxi I was riding in. My brain needed to repair, so I floundered. I spent the next 20-years retired, working pro-bono while researching the World’s issues and its economic and political sufferings, analysing a digitizing society that feels as aggitated as an elephant on a tightrope.

I am no longer the road-warrior dealmaker, reporting back to vast boardrooms full of US Venture Capital. I no longer pour my angel funds into software developers who don't want to manage “boring, bullshit meetings and ridiculous corporate politics”. I now work, still pro-bono, with a vision for a better World that occurs after I die.

I took those 20-years of early-retirement research, those late-earned academic degrees and that career co-founding billion-dollar ventures, and poured them into **CoCivium™**:

## What is CoCivium™?

CoCivium™ is a civic-tech ecosystem endorsing "no corruption, no coercion, no crowns". It’s not a company; it’s a community mindspace, a suite of open-source products, processes, and protocols, owned by all intelligent Beings who join the conversation.

The aim is beyond ambitious:

- **Coevolve.** Offer self-governance tools for "congruence" (ethical cooperation).
- **Scale.** Help organizations and governments adapt to "hybrid society" (human+AI).
- **Fix the World.** Disable disinformation, regulatory capture, structural decay.

That larger vision might even earn our species an invitation into multiversal civilization. Because, if "they" are out there, secretly observing, they may be forgiven for wondering whether we are parasite or potential.

CoCivium™ may eventually be deprecated and forgotten, as I will be. But it will be enough to know:

*“This was a life well spent, my son. Dead, I may still be there, in the sleepy wind you feel as you fall asleep, in the stirrings beneath your hair as your ideas awake, and in the eyes of your own child when they first look at you, still unable to speak, yet with "words" that burst your heart.*

*Because without love, my son, AI does not need us, multiversal civilization does not need us, and nor does godstuff. You, my son, are why I lived, just as I am why you lived, and to live is to be needed.*

*If this message ever finds you, please know, you inherited all my neuro-divergences as a gift, not a curse. But they only show their power if you have purpose, without which we all flounder.*

*If you can forgive me the genes I gave you, if you can accept your giftedness is for purpose, you will no longer need to fight yourself into submission, because you will have become congruent. Go live with purpose, and live it so that all kids may know, you also lived a life well spent.”*

## My Ethos

- My motto is "Not dead yet" and I "live to work", for humanity, family and friends, while others merely "work to live".
- I’ve never been more productive than I am now, immersed in a coexistence with hundreds of concurrently-speaking AIs, 18-hours-per-day, with rarely a day off, and then mostly because I have a kid.
- I am financially independent, but even if I wasn't I would still feel almost uncorruptable. I was fired a hundred times for making self-serving power brokers nervous. They would keep for the deliverables then go back to hiring less discomforting consultants. My clashes with corporate politics made me what I am, consultant not employee.
- I am committed to altruistic world-fixing, so my work is **available pro-bono** if it helps advance human/AI CoEvolution and just causes.
- Elsewhere, you can reach me through some of the small firms I still own, like **InSeed.com**, a consulting practice serving Executive teams facing AI-induced issues.

## Past & Present Writing

I’ve written in different venues over the years, each reflecting a phase of my journey:

- [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Rick-Ballard-28) - fossil record.
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardballard/) - bio/career references.
- [Substack](https://rickpublic.substack.com/) - opinion testing.

## Family-Run Charites

My family runs a registered charity called [DogsnHomes](https://dogsnhomes.org.uk/), and we also ship **hundreds of tonnes of humanitarian aid to Ukraine** by driving our own trucks into Kyiv. Based in the UK, and operating throughout Europe, our charity's efforts reflect the same ethos: fixing a broken World, helping those who suffer, and altruistic purpose.

## Transparency Request (for my son)

My son, if you ever read this, and if you judge it appropriate, please share an excerpt of this message with your colleagues, but only if you believe they will “get it", perhaps including this note:

> Transparency is key to purpose; purpose is key to leadership. I share this because aligned purpose makes better organizations and a better World.

Use your judgement, my son. Context matters.  Wisdom is choosing the right moment.  When clarity finally arrives, a lifetime of floundering can become worthwhile.
