# Influencer & Media Campaign — Starter Pack

**Goal:** Earn public review and thoughtful endorsements for CoCoCivium’s consent‑first governance pack.  Drive contributors to adapters and pilots.

**KPIs:** Views on article, RFC comments, signatories, roundtable RSVPs, stars/forks on adapters, media mentions.

## Workstreams
1. Research & List-Building — fill `influencers_template.csv`.
2. Visuals — network map (faces/logos only with permission/license), badges, diagrams.
3. Article — see `Substack_Article_Outline.md`.
4. Outreach — adapt `Outreach_Scripts.md`.  Prioritize Tier‑A first.
5. Press — use `Press_Pitch.md`.  Offer embargoed access to one outlet.
6. Roundtables — 3 slots across time zones; publish notes.

## Guardrails
- Transparency: analysis ≠ endorsement; disclaimers on visuals.
- Consent: secure license/permission for any likeness use; otherwise use silhouettes/avatars.
- No astroturf: label outreach as CoCivium; avoid manipulative framings.
- Measurability: define pre‑publish thresholds; stop/iterate if KPIs miss by >50% after 72h.

## Timeline (example)
- Day 1–2: List build + permissions.  Draft visuals.  Dry‑run with 3 advisors.
- Day 3: Publish Substack + repo kit.  Seed to Tier‑A.  Pitch 1–2 journalists.
- Day 4–7: Run roundtables.  Capture quotes.  Ship follow‑up post with deltas.
