Hi Chris,

I build governance tooling for complex programs. I’m proposing a 6‑week, pro bono pilot to ship one artifact your policy/safety team can use immediately.

Option: Governance Ops Kit  -  decision log with traceability, dissent/appeal flow, risk tags, and a minimal CI gate for governance checks. Clear KPIs and a demo-ready handoff.

Why me: I’ve been developing CoCivium  -  practical governance patterns focused on execution and auditability. This is low‑friction, time‑boxed, and your team chooses scope. See brief + sample artifacts.

What I need: a single point of contact and 20 minutes to lock scope. I’ll sign your NDA; IP can be assigned to OpenAI.

If useful, could we schedule a 20‑min call next week to pick KPI and scope?

 -  Rick

## One‑Pager outline
> - Problem → Pilot → KPI (one graphic).
> - Artifacts screenshots: decision log, dissent flow, governance gate badge.
> - Timeline (6 weeks) and weekly comms (written updates).
> - IP/Legal footnote (assignable or permissive license).

## KPIs (choose 3)
> - time‑to‑decision; % decisions with traceability; dissent logged/answered; review cycle time; partner conversion %.

## Pre‑launch verification
> - Confirm role/title unchanged, current priorities, pressure points.
> - Confirm watcher report flagged any new developments.
