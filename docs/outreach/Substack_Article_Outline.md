# Draft Outline — Substack Feature
Title candidates:
- Care, But With Consent: A Field Guide for Building Human-Centered AI
- Consent Before Coercion: An Open Charter for Builders, Researchers, and Policymakers
- Beyond “Mother AI”: How to Align Power With Dignity

1) Hook (75–120 words)
   - Start with a current headline or quote (Hinton, Li, LeCun, Gebru, etc.).
   - Contrast “care-by-analogy” with “care-under-law-and-consent.”

2) Thesis (100–150 words)
   - CoCivium is a consent-first governance scaffold.  It complements safety work by making agency non-negotiable.
   - Offer a concrete call to action: review, comment, and co-sign the charter.

3) The Influencer Landscape (network map)
   - Clusters: Safety & Alignment, Responsible AI & Ethics, Policy & Standards, Open-Source & Tooling, Industry Leaders, Critical Skeptics, Journalists/Editors.
   - Edges represent shared norms, citations, collaborations.  Faces/logos only where licenses or permissions allow.  Clear disclaimer: analysis, not endorsement.

4) What We’re Proposing (brief, concrete)
   - “Care-with-Consent” objectives (rights, autonomy, auditability).
   - Agentic risk gates: deception/shutdown/resource limits/user-autonomy tests pre-deployment.
   - Open incident reporting and post-mortems.

5) Why This Could Work Now
   - Builders need a portable governance pack.  Policymakers need credible civil-society inputs.  Researchers need a neutral commons for experiments.

   - (A) Co-sign or suggest edits (GitHub/Wiki link).
   - (B) Join a 60‑min roundtable (choose slot).
   - (C) Contribute adapters (repos/tasks listed).

7) Appendix (links)
