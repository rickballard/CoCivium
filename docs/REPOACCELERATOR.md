# RepoAccelerator (Workbench)
Session-managed helper that:
- enables the `???` CoPong trigger **per session** (no profile writes),
- prints planned-wait **yellow** banners (no silent sleeps), and
- shows **End of DO Set** green demarks.

**Notes**
- Trigger washes away on PS7 exit; products must disable on shutdown.
- Manual paste of PS7 output in chat **counts as a CoPong**.
- Optional enhancement: if AutoHotkey v2 is already installed, users may map a mouse-chord to paste (documented separately; off by default).
