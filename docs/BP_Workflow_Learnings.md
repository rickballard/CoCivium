# Branch Protection & Workflow Learnings (Living Log)
> Purpose: capture mistakes + fixes to improve contributor experience while protecting canon.

## 2025-09-11 — Initial Entries
- **Mistake:** Over-gating early docs discouraged contributions.  
  **Fix:** Introduced mistake-welcoming tiers (0–2) with bot grooming; escalations governed by CanonScore.

- **Mistake:** Bot PRs lacked provenance and occasionally altered meaning.  
  **Fix:** Grooming Charter; require model/seed/prompt hashes; forbid policy/consent/safety edits without RFC.

- **Mistake:** Canonical docs changed ad‑hoc.  
  **Fix:** Change windows + signed commits + RFC when CanonScore drop ≥5.

(Add entries with date, mistake, fix, evidence links.)
