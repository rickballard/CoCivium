# Idea Log (running)

- The CC should be long and quotable; Annexes hold details; quotes should stay stable (separate Maxims).
- Prefer timeless motifs (curlicues / symbolics) over faces or hardware photos.
- Symbols can be live-linked (online) and degrade to text (print/offline).
- Chip-tile image is temporary; replace with fungal-neural scroll art.
- Keep harvesting all prior CoCivium scroll material before any rewrite.
