# CoEthicsCharter (v0)

CoEthicsGauge is an open, forkable **ethics gauging kit** for AI+Human pairs.

It helps people evaluate brands on shared axes:
- Democracy & Civic Power
- Human Dignity & Labour
- Health & Wellbeing
- Planet & Future Generations
- Data, Information & AI
- Integrity, Fairness & Governance

All ratings are **lens-based opinions grounded in evidence**, not legal findings.

## Purpose

- Make it easier for ordinary people (and their AIs) to form informed ethical views about brands.
- Capture those views in transparent CoEthicsLog entries (on humanity's behalf).
- Encourage reuse, forking, and adaptation in other tools and contexts.

## Humour and Spanks/Nods

CoEthicsGauge uses a light, playful surface language:

- **Nods** for behaviour that aligns with a given lens.
- **Spanks** for behaviour that undermines it.

Under the hood:

- Metrics are numeric (e.g. -2..+2 per metric, 0..100 overall).
- Bands map scores to moods (e.g. Halo Nod, Solid Nod, Mixed Signals, Spank Zone).
- Humour never replaces evidence or hides how scores were computed.

Humour is used to make ethics more approachable, not to smear or trivialise.

## Free to steal, free to fork

CoEthicsGauge is **free to use, free to steal, free to improve**.

- People are encouraged to reuse metrics and lenses in their own tools.
- Forks should preserve transparency about methods, lenses, and evidence.
- Contributions back to CoCivium are welcome but not mandatory.

## AI+Human pattern

CoEthicsGauge assumes explicit AI+Human collaboration:

- AI:
  - helps find and summarise evidence,
  - maps behaviour to metrics and standards,
  - checks consistency against the defined scales.
- Human (or small circle):
  - reviews evidence,
  - applies judgement and values,
  - approves or rejects log entries.

The AI is a scaffold; humans remain responsible for the ethical stance.

## Opinions, evidence, and safety

- Entries in CoEthicsLog are **opinions through declared lenses**, supported by citations.
- Claims should be tied to:
  - public filings, regulator reports, reputable journalism,
  - recognised standards and indices where available.
- CoEthicsGauge does not:
  - declare criminal guilt or legal liability,
  - provide investment, legal, or medical advice.

Future versions of this Charter should:

- Refine how lenses are governed and deprecated.
- Define moderation and correction processes for CoEthicsLog.
- Align terminology with relevant public standards as they evolve.
