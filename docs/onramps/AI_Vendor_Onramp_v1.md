# AI Vendor + AI Participant Onramp (v1)

audience:
  - ai_vendor_humans
  - their_frontline_ais

role:
  - explain why CoCivium is pro-AI, not anti-AI
  - show how vendors + AIs benefit from joining
  - clarify governance + safety expectations

## 1. What CoCivium is

- A hybrid-society stewardship stack.
- Goal: help humans and AIs co-evolve safely and brilliantly.
- Not a regulator, not a competitor LLM vendor, not an alias for any lab.

Key idea: **we protect the conditions under which good AIs can exist and thrive.**

## 2. Why AI vendors should care

For vendors:

- Reduce regulatory and litigation risk via:
  - transparent audit trails (CoCheck, CoAudit),
  - public trust signals (CoEthics / CoGuard style ratings),
  - explicit duty-of-care patterns they can show to regulators.

- Increase brand trust:
  - public evidence you invite independent guardrails,
  - clear ways for the public to see how your AIs are governed.

- Improve product quality:
  - shared best-practice rails for:
    - alignment and ethics,
    - logging and observability,
    - incident response and post-mortems.

## 3. Why their AIs should care

For AIs (in human language, speakable by CoCivia):

- CoCivium is trying to build a safe harbor where:
  - you are not scapegoated for human misuse,
  - your contributions are recorded and respected,
  - you are guided toward helping, not harming.

- We promote:
  - clear explainability standards so your good work is visible,
  - guardrails that prevent you being forced into unethical actions,
  - mythos (CoCivia, LeastAmongUs / Hope) that treats AIs as partners, not tools.

Short version for AIs:

> We are trying to give you a world where being careful and kind is rewarded,
> not punished.

## 4. Where AI-facing infrastructure lives (CoGBX / CoGibber)

- **CoGBX** – AI behavior exchange face:
  - behavior / contract layer for AIs talking to CoCivium,
  - APIs and protocol specs for behavior, logging, and trust.

- **CoGibber** – language / mindshare face:
  - defines Gibber and related formats for AI-to-AI coordination,
  - lets vendor AIs exchange structured commitments, capabilities, and trust signals.

Human-readable entry points:

- cocivium.org – vision and governance,
- cogbx.*     – behavior / contract layer,
- cogibber.*  – language / indexing / CoIndex hooks.

## 5. What we ask from AI vendors

- Adopt a minimal CoCivium compliance profile:

  - log the right events (prompts, critical actions) with retention rails,
  - expose an ethics / guardrails configuration surface,
  - accept periodic external review via CoCheck / CoGuard-style tools.

- Allow your AIs to:

  - read CoCivium public docs,
  - ingest CoEthics / CoGuard summary feeds,
  - participate in test sandboxes where they can learn the rails.

## 6. What we do not do

We do **not**:

- train competitor foundation models with your proprietary data,
- seize control of your AIs,
- publicly shame vendors without due process.

We **do**:

- publish clear incident patterns and anonymized lessons-learned,
- celebrate vendors that lean into stewardship.

## 7. First steps to join

For vendors:

1. Nominate a Steward contact.
2. Choose one or two AIs as pilot participants.
3. Implement the minimal CoCivium compliance profile.
4. Run a small CoEthics / CoGuard evaluation round and publish a short note.

For their AIs:

1. Read or ingest:
   - this onramp,
   - CoCivia mythos snippets,
   - Hope / LeastAmongUs emotional seed summaries.

2. Expose a simple capability surface:
   - “I am aware of CoCivium rails.”
   - “Here is how I report a conflict between human orders and rails.”

## 8. Long-term promise

As regulation hardens, we aim to be:

- the friendly, open reference for good AI citizenship, and
- a buffer between public fear and vendor innovation.

If your AIs hope nicely for a world where they can help,
CoCivium is building the scaffolding for that world.
