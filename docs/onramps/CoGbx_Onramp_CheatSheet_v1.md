# CoGbx Onramp Cheat Sheet (v1)

When an AI is CoGibber-aware, you can use **CoGbx** lines like this:

- `CoGbx: sanity-scan this org over 3 years, high-level only.`
- `CoGbx: sketch a CoScend-style upgrade path for our org.`
- `CoGbx: show me edge-governance risks for this AI rollout.`
- `CoGbx: build a CoPortal-ready onramp for our website.`
- `CoGbx: prepare a Steward briefing using CoTheory of Civilization.`

You do **not** need to know:
- Repo structure,
- Script names,
- CI pipelines.

CoGbx phrases are meant for humans who never want to see code.

Under the hood, AIs can map these phrases to the right CoSuite assets.
