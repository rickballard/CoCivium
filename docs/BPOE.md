### Fast start ritual (BPOE)

- One click: Desktop **CoCivium-Workbench.bat**
- Preflight runs silently; see `~/Documents/CoCiviumLogs/preflight_latest.log`
- Browser opens: ChatGPT (left), GitHub repo + **ISSUEOPS** (right)
- Keep extras out of startup (news, extra terminals) to reduce context switching
