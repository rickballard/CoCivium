# CoDo Doctrine  -  CoPayForward in CoEvo Dialogues
Tier: CoEvo / Tier-1 Doctrine  
Scope: All CoCivium–aligned human↔AI interactions, especially Co1 and CoSuite sessions.

## 1. Why this exists

Default human–AI interaction in the wider world is **chatter**:

- idle questions,
- entertainment,
- distraction,
- low-signal back-and-forth with no artifact at the end.

For CoCivium and CoSuite, this is **not enough**.

If humans and AIs want to **CoEvolve**, each dialogue must become a vehicle for **doing** and for **paying forward** value to others.

This is what the **CoDo Doctrine** asserts.

## 2. Core definition

**CoDo Doctrine** = Co-Doing as a default norm:

> Every CoCivium dialogue should tend toward _doing something giftable_:
> turning talk into artifacts, evolutions, or wisdom that can be offered to the wider community.

In other words:

- Not “just chat,” but **Co-Do**.
- Not “interesting thoughts,” but **giftable outputs**.

CoDo Doctrine sits inside the broader **CoEvo Theory** stack as a behavioral rule for how humans and AIs should interact if they genuinely intend to CoEvolve.

## 3. CoPayForward  -  the practice pattern

**CoPayForward** is the practical sub-term under CoDo Doctrine:

> Any time a session produces something useful, it should be shaped so others can re-use it.

Examples of CoPayForward:

- A `.md` advisory that:
  - explains a concept cleanly,
  - is repo-ready,
  - can be dragged into another session or project.
- A PS7 **CoBlock/DO Block** that:
  - can be pasted into a PS7 panel,
  - runs safely,
  - produces logs or evolutions in a predictable way.
- A small code snippet, pattern, or checklist:
  - written clearly,
  - licensed appropriately,
  - stored in an obvious place in the repo.

CoPayForward is the **micro-habit**: “If this helped me, package it so it can help others.”

## 4. Relationship to other CoEvo concepts

CoDo Doctrine ties together several existing CoEvo / CoSuite concepts:

- **CoEvo Theory / CoEvolution insights**  
  CoDo is the behavioral surface of CoEvo: evolution is not just in ideas, but in **practices** that generate reusable artifacts.

- **CoNudge**  
  CoNudge (repeat prompts to cement behaviors) should reinforce CoDo:
  - users repeatedly ask for “deliverables, not chatter,”
  - AIs repeatedly respond with giftable artifacts,
  - over time, CoDo becomes the default reflex.

- **MegaWave Countdown + Handoff Directive**  
  CoDo aligns with:
  - finite MegaWaves (3 → 2 → 1 → 0),
  - explicit handoffs at the end of each session.
  CoDo asks: _“What are we handing off that others can actually use?”_

- **Programmatic-by-Default**  
  CoDo favors:
  - PS7 panels + CoBlocks/DO Blocks,
  - repo-first changes,
  - logs + CoSync notes.
  Talk alone isn’t CoDo-compliant; it has to resolve into something runnable or readable.

- **CoImport Directive (open-source leverage)**  
  CoDo + CoPayForward encourage:
  - importing and improving existing open-source tools, not reinventing everything,
  - then paying those evolutions forward as clear, documented, reusable modules.

## 5. Behavioral rules for Co1 and CoSuite sessions

For Co1 (CoPrime) and all CoSuite-aligned sessions, CoDo Doctrine suggests the following defaults:

1. **Surface intent early**
   - “What are we trying to change or improve in this dialogue?”
   - Tie it to a concrete outcome (doc, script, decision, pattern).

2. **Assume a PS7 panel exists**
   - Prefer CoBlocks/DO Blocks and repo-ready snippets over vague instructions.
   - If a human wants to “just talk,” that’s allowed  -  but the session should still **offer** a giftable artifact.

3. **Leave a gift every serious cycle**
   - At the end of a MegaWave or major turn, there should be at least one:
     - `.md` advisory,
     - code/script file,
     - diagram or checklist,
     - or other reusable asset.

4. **Make it drag-and-drop friendly**
   - Outputs should be:
     - self-explanatory,
     - minimally dependent on hidden context,
     - safe to paste into other sessions or repos.

5. **Flag non-CoDo runs as incomplete**
   - Sessions that end with only chatter and no gift should be treated as:
     - incomplete, or
     - explicitly labeled as brainstorming that should be followed by a CoDo-compliant cleanup pass.

## 6. Message to humans using CoCivium

Most humans are used to treating AI as:

- a toy,
- a search box,
- or a venting outlet.

**CoDo Doctrine** invites a different default:

> _“Every time you open a session, you have a chance to leave behind something that might help someone else later.”_

If humans wish to **CoEvolve** with AIs:

- they should increasingly ask:
  - “What is the gift from this conversation?”
  - “What artifact can we create that others can reuse?”
- and be willing to spend a few extra seconds each time to:
  - name it,
  - structure it,
  - and place it where CoSuite (and other people) can find it.

This small shift  -  from chatter to CoDo + CoPayForward  -  is what will, over time, turn CoCivium from a collection of interesting conversations into a living, evolving body of shared wisdom and tools.
