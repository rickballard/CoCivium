# CoTip: “A and A” voice cue for multi-line pastes

When pasting DO blocks into PS7, Windows may ask for confirmation.
Say “A and A” in your head: **A** (Accept) then **A** (Allow) → press **Alt+A** if available,
or confirm with Enter. This keeps the rhythm of “Copy → Paste → A-and-A → Enter”.

Also keep a consistent cadence for block labels: **DO-A, DO-B, DO-C…**
