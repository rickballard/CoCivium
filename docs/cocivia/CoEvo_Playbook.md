Purpose
- Teach teams how to widen the option set and evolve ideas safely.
- Make evolution measurable with simple moves anyone can use.

Cadence
- Weekly light cycle: listen, generate, test, reflect, publish internal.

Moves
- Mutate: change the frame and restate the question.
- Recombine: merge winners and seek pareto gains.
- Speciate: split a big idea into small safe trials.
- Retire: log and sunset ideas that fail ethics or safety.

Pressures
- Entropy floor 0.25 so options do not collapse.
- Novelty budget 0.30 to explore beyond the known.

- Cover at least three domains: civic, tech, legal, org, narrative, aesthetic.
- Note a simple rollback for each option.

Song cues
