## Done
- Added .gitattributes and renormalized LF endings.
- Rewrote CI: .github/workflows/eol-check.yml to guard CRLF reliably.
- Retired deprecated-sweep.yml (moved to .github/workflows/_disabled/).
- Opened PR #136 (chore/eol-and-sweep-fixes).
- Opened PR #135 (ISSUEOPS quick-start cheatsheet).
- Test-ran ol-check on branch, then re-disabled to keep noise low.
