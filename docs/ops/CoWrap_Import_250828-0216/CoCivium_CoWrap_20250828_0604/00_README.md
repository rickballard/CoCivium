# CoCivium CoWrap Pack — 20250828_0604

This bundle pulls together active plans, checklists, and notes from the migration + “other session,”
adds the **CoEvolution** write‑up, and captures open items + a forward plan.

**How to use**
1. Skim `01_Forward_Plan.md` for the phase view (P0–P3).
2. If you need the philosophy/operating model, read `02_CoEvolution.md`.
3. Use `03_Sentinels_and_Policy_Nudges.md`, `04_Protected_Docs.md`, and `06_History_Hygiene.md` as reference checklists.
4. The folder `attached/` contains the raw materials you shared (unaltered).
