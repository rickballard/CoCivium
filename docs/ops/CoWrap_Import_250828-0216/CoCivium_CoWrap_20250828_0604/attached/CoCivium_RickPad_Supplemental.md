# CoCivium™ RickPad  -  Supplemental (Session Wrap)

This memo captures policies and patterns we discussed so you can drop them into the repo with minimal friction. It favors “teach, don’t punish” and keeps canonical docs human‑reviewed while giving contributors fast lanes.

---

## 1) CoCivium™ Recursion Policy (search before you spawn)

**Intent:** Before creating a new asset (policy / initiative / idea / framework), search existing repos for overlap to integrate instead of proliferate.

**Minimum bar (author checklist):**
- Run a whole‑org search for nearby terms, neighboring acronyms, and obvious synonyms.
- If similar artifacts exist, choose: extend, alias, or deprecate  -  don’t fork concepts.
- Add a *Why new?* note in your PR body summarizing what exists and why this is additive.

**Quick commands** (pick your shell):
- PowerShell (rg): `rg -n --hidden -S "your phrase|closest synonyms" -g '!{.git,node_modules,dist,build}'`
- GitHub code search (paste in PR): `repo:org/* "your phrase"` (+ synonyms)
- Markdown link your 3 most relevant hits in the PR under **Related**.

**Light automation (non‑blocking idea):**
- GH Action on PRs: run a recursive search for the new file’s title tokens and post a comment with the top matches. This remains advisory, never blocks merges.

---

## 2) “Living History of CoCivium™” (yearly, for future historians)

**Location:** [docs/history/](docs/history/)
**Files:**
- `INDEX.md`  -  one‑page timeline with links.
- `YYYY.md`  -  yearly chapter (vision vs. reality, pivots, lessons).
- `people/rick.md`  -  profile of Rick (ethos, style, preferences, notable work).
- `glossary.md`  -  terms that emerged that year (with first‑seen links).

**Yearly chapter template ([docs/history/2025.md](docs/history/2025.md)):**
```md
# 2025 Year in Review
## Vision → Reality
- original intent:
- what actually shipped / changed:
## Highlights & Pivots
## Experiments (kept / sunset)
## Community & Contributors
## “What we learned” (bullets)
## Next Year Bets
```

**Maintenance cadence:** open an issue every December titled “History: prepare YYYY review”; close in January after merge.

---

## 3) Doc‑specific check relaxation (“never block, always teach”)

**Principle:** Text‑based readables (docs, guides) should *not* block contributor flow. Guards are advisory; they surface findings **after** the footer without altering intent.

**Mechanics options:**

- **PR Comment Report (preferred):** the guard posts a comment with findings and suggested fixes. Zero file churn.
- **Sidecar report file:** write `yourfile.md.lint.md` in the same folder (ignored by the site build) that lists findings and proposed patches.
- **Inline footer block (when desired):** append a clearly delimited section at the end of the changed doc:
  ```md
  <!-- LINT-REPORT:BEGIN -->
  _Advisory notes autogenerated; remove after addressing._

  - “consent before coercion” → **consent not coercion** (Rationale: unambiguous wording)
  - Consider replacing “users” with “people/participants” if you mean humans.
  <!-- LINT-REPORT:END -->
  ```

**Canonicals exception:** For CC, constitutions, and other primary canonicals, keep the guards advisory but **require** human review (CODEOWNERS) before merge.

---

## 4) Poetry conventions (clear signaling, careful phrasing)

**Goal:** Allow artistic language for inspiration while preventing policy‑sounding misreads.

**Marking poetry:**
- Frontmatter: `poetic: true` **or** `guard_exempt: ["nasties"]`
- Inline: `<!-- guard:ignore-start -->` … `<!-- guard:ignore-end -->` or `<!-- guard:ignore-line -->`
- Presentation conventions (any two): italics, blockquote, or quotation marks. In .md prefer italics + blockquote:
  ```md
  > _“We plant shade for those yet to arrive.”_
  ```

**Poetry review pass:** sanity‑scan metaphors for unintended readings (e.g., avoid idioms that could imply harm or exclusion).

---

## 5) CoAgent positioning (aka “vibecoder” layer)

**What it is:** A *vibe‑aware guidance layer* that helps teams keep language, intent, and policy congruent across repos, PRs, and releases.

**Packaging tracks (non‑exclusive):**
1. **ChatGPT extension / GPT:** streamline as a targeted writing assistant that understands the Nasties Bucket, Sentinels, and house style.
2. **API middleware:** a small service that lints, suggests, and auto‑patches docs via webhooks / CI, returning diffs.
3. **OSS core + Pro SaaS:** open a minimal library (repo lints + style rules) and offer hosted reporting, history, and analytics.

**Category:** “Vibe plugin” / governance‑aware writing copilot.

---

## 6) Confidential bits pattern (when some files shouldn’t be world‑readable)

**Default stance:** open by default. When justified, gate *documents*, not repos.

**Recommended tooling:**
- **Age/SOPS** for file‑level encryption in‑repo.
- **Bitwarden** as your personal key vault (store the decryption key/cert).
- Git ignore decrypted outputs; keep only `*.enc` committed.
- Provide a one‑liner to decrypt:
  ```pwsh
  bw unlock | sops -d docs/private/plan.enc.md > docs/private/plan.md
  ```

**Operational guardrails:**
- Keep an unencrypted public abstract/teaser checked in (so the tree stays navigable).
- Never commit decrypted files; add pre‑commit hook to reject them.
- Log who decrypted when (local script can append a line to a private audit log).

---

## 7) Migration wrap pattern (Grand Migration, then breathe)

**High‑level moves:**
- Freeze: pause non‑urgent PRs and tag the state.
- Sweep: run readme smoke, link check, codespell, nasties advisory.
- Wire: CODEOWNERS and soft guards, unify editorial voice in README/USER_GUIDE.
- Archive: mark deprecated folders with `README_DEPRECATED.md` explaining successors.
- Announce: short post linking to the “Living History” chapter and what’s next.

(We omit time estimates by policy; execute in this order to minimize churn.)

---

## 8) Telemetry, upgrades, and product insights (privacy‑first)

**Telemetry principles:**
- **Opt‑in by default** (set `telemetry: false` unless the person explicitly enables).
- Capture only **coarse** events: feature used, success/fail, duration band; no payloads.
- Let people see & purge their local telemetry cache.
- Document the event taxonomy in [docs/ops/telemetry/EVENTS.md](docs/ops/telemetry/EVENTS.md).

**Implementation sketch:**
- Emit newline‑delimited JSON into a local buffer.
- Batch to a simple collector endpoint; if unreachable, silently drop.
- Add an *in‑app “Check for updates”* that hits a static `releases.json` on GitHub Pages and surfaces notes.
- Provide a **Performance Diary** switch that logs timings locally for the next N sessions and then turns off.

---

## 9) Final polish ethic (snippets, quotes, reputation)

- Write as if any snippet could be screenshot and stripped of context.
- Prefer **“consent not coercion”** and similarly unambiguous phrasing.
- Avoid absolutisms (“AI replaces humans”) unless you defend them explicitly.
- Canonicals get a human pass; poetry gets a gentler pass but still a sanity check.
