# CoWrap – Short Checklist

- [ ] Link this RickPad supplemental from `docs/ops/policy/SENTINELS.md`.
- [ ] Create `docs/history/INDEX.md` + `docs/history/<YEAR>.md` from the template.
- [ ] Add `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/history_year.yml` for December reminder.
- [ ] Keep **nasties** guard advisory; ensure PR template checkbox exists.
- [ ] Adopt poetry markers (`poetic: true` / guard ignore comments) where needed.
- [ ] Decide CoAgent packaging track(s) to pursue first (GPT ext / middleware / OSS+SaaS).
- [ ] If any confidential docs are justified, encrypt with SOPS; store keys in Bitwarden.
- [ ] Stand up telemetry skeleton (opt‑in, coarse events, local buffer, releases.json check).
- [ ] Run final‑polish pass on canonicals for screenshot‑safe snippets & quotes.
