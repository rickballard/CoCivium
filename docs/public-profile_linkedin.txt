Founder, civic-tech architect, recovering dealmaker. Co-founded $B ventures, then chose a harder path: helping fix a world sliding into corruption, coercion, and kings.

I live to work (and for my family). Now I work mostly on CoCivium — an open ecosystem to reduce disinformation and structural coercion, and to enable human–AI co-evolution at scale. Financially independent and (I hope) uncorruptable, I’m available pro-bono when the mission advances just causes; for sustainable efforts, I route income via InSeed.com.

If your project helps people become more co-evolved, let’s talk.
