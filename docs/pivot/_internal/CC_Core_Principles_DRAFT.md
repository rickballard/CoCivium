# Cognocarta Consenti — Core Principles (DRAFT, ≤500 words)

**Purpose.** Provide a stable, short set of principles that anchor CoCivium’s modules and reviews. This is not a full constitution; clause language follows practice.

1) **Consent-before-coercion.** Public interventions require clear purpose, least-coercive means, and documented consent pathways or lawful due process.
2) **Activation rights.** People affected can trigger review, remedy, or rollback through accessible channels (including judicial access).
3) **Transparency-with-SLAs.** Defaults are public unless narrowly exempt; publication has deadlines, formats, and uptime/service targets.
4) **Reversibility & auditability.** Emergency or experimental changes are time-bound with automatic sunset, logged, and reversible with evidence trails.
5) **Standards-anchored practice.** We map outputs to open standards (e.g., DCAT/OCDS/BODS) or declared equivalents that pass validators.
6) **Federated adoption.** Jurisdictions can localize clauses and data shapes so long as conformance tests pass and evidence remains public.
7) **Human oversight of AI.** AI may assist; humans remain accountable. No deployment without human review, red-teaming, and appeal paths (HumanGate).
8) **Proportionality & harm minimization.** Measures scale with risk; we prioritize remedies that reduce rights/civil harm first.
9) **Evidence-first governance.** Policies ship with machine-checkable tests and IRM-style evidence tables; pass/fail is visible to the public.
10) **Equity & access.** Interfaces, formats, and processes must be practically reachable to diverse communities and do not create discriminatory barriers.

**How we use this.**  
- Design: every module cites which principles it operationalizes.  
- Review: conformance checks include a principle-impact note.  
- Veto: statistical “wins” may be rejected if they violate these principles.
