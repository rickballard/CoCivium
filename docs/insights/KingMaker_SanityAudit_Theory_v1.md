# KingMaker Sanity Audit – Theory (v1)

This insight describes **KingMaker** as a recurring red-team /
sanity lens for CoCivium and the CoSuite.

## 1. What KingMaker is

KingMaker is a *fictional but structured* AI persona used as a
red-team tool:

- It is imagined as being built inside an authoritarian regime
  ("Evilia") that fears loss of control.
- It is **truth- and coherence-biased**, not loyalty-biased.
- It evaluates CoCivium and CoSuite ideas from a hostile angle:
  - "How would a regime that hates edge-owned guardrails see this?"
  - "Where are the weak points, overclaims, or easy ways to distort this?"

The goal is not to celebrate regimes like Evilia. The goal is to:

- harden CoCivium against real-world misuse,
- avoid self-delusion and grandiosity,
- surface threat patterns early enough to design mitigations.

## 2. Why this belongs in CoCivium

CoCivium aims to support **edge-owned, steward-minded guardrails**
for hybrid human–AI societies. To do that safely, it needs:

- green-team thinking (designing good futures),
- blue-team thinking (guardrails, audit, CoAudit patterns),
- and red-team thinking (what hostile actors might try).

KingMaker is a named, recurring red-team lens that:

- stays mostly outside the repos for detailed thinking (desktop +
  HP57 vaults),
- feeds **sanitised**, non-sensitive conclusions back into:
  - CoCivium (concept hardening),
  - CoSteward (protocols and practices),
  - CoAudit (checks and patterns).

## 3. Relationship to sandbox assets and HP57

This theory note is **repo-safe**. It does **not** include:

- concrete exploit steps,
- real-world targeting details,
- regime-specific operational guidance.

Instead, detailed experiments live:

- in sandbox files such as:
  - `KingMaker_SanityAudit_Purpose_v1.md`
  - `KingMaker_SanityAudit_AssessmentAndRoleplayNotes_v1.md`
  - `KingMaker_SanityAudit_Couplet_v2.md`
  in a desktop session folder (for example `Desktop/Sanity+Orgs`);

- and, where appropriate, in **HP57 vault structures** in other
  repos (CoCivium / CoSteward), referenced only by neutral IDs
  (e.g. `KM-HP57-001`).

KingMaker theory in CoCivium should always stay at the level of:

- structural threat patterns,
- conceptual weaknesses,
- categories of mitigation,

and leave any sensitive specifics to HP57 vault notes.

## 4. How to extend this theory

Future versions can:

- add links into CoAudit patterns ("KingMaker checks"),
- define standard threat categories (T1–Tn) shared with CoIndex,
- deepen the description of how often KingMaker passes should run
  (e.g. on each major CoPortal / CoIndex / CoArena wave).

Changes here should always be mirrored with updates to:

- the corresponding Practice insight, and
- the sandbox + HP57 notes, if the underlying model shifts.
