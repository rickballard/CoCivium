# Asset A — Harmonious Intelligence under Constitutional Guardrails

**TL;DR:** Harmony = constraint-compatible plurality. CoCivium functions as a selection environment; agents “meld” constitutionally (rules, tests, reversible diffs), not via identity fusion. Treat CoCivium canon+tools+evals as the *operational extended self* (pinned by commit/sha), while human primacy and plural providers prevent monoculture.

## Core Claims
- **Extended Self:** CoCivium’s canon/tools/evals, when pinned and mandatory, become part of an agent’s operational identity.
- **Constitutional Meld:** Safety comes from guardrails (reversibility, objection windows, evidence trails) and eval-before-merge.
- **Evolution Vector:** Selection pressure via metrics, incidents→tests, A/B prompts, and tool swaps.

## Idea Nuggets
1. Harmony ≠ uniformity; require provider pluralism + dissent windows.
2. Truth via tethers: cite `canon@commit` or `artifact@sha256`.
3. Reversibility by design; small diffs and cheap rollbacks.
4. Evidence trails as culture (PRs, hashes, citations).
5. Incidents must produce new tests before retry.
6. Capability caps earn expansion via eval results.
7. Golden paths: tagged few-shot libraries and DO blocks.
8. Freshness rules (prefer <60d merges for policy).
9. Multi-agent deliberation → reconcile to falsifiable predictions.
10. Convivial, auditable tools (PS7 + declarative runners).
11. CoBloat meter (CU/PU/HU/WT) at each step.
12. Open conscience on public outputs (rationale, sources, rollback notes).

## Phases (0→3)
0) Agents propose notes/diffs; humans merge.  
1) Auto-merge low-risk green evals (docs/links) + instant rollback.  
2) Multi-agent proposals + human arbitration; mandatory post-mortems.  
3) Bounded autonomy under caps; kill-switch retained.

## Prompts for the Luminaries (use/adapt)
- **Harmonies Map (one-pager)** using the five rails.
- **Falsifiable Bridge:** 3 predictions distinguishing central planning, laissez-faire, and constitutional meld.
- **Classroom Pack Seed:** 45-min lesson outline with rubric.
