# Cognocarta Consenti (CC)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/cc/cc-crest.png" alt="Cognocarta Consenti (CC)  -  living constitution for digital society" width="420">
</p>

**Mission:** Build the **living constitution for digital society** - borderless, people-first, and **directly evolvable by anyone who cares**.

**Project:** **CoCivium™** is the open-source community that **writes, tests, and ships the CC** - plus the policies, processes, and tools that keep **hybrid life (physical + digital)** **democratic, equitable, and aligned** with human values.

> If you can read this page, you’re qualified to help. No coding or civics degree required.

## Why now (plain language)

- **Analog rules in a digital era.** Yesterday’s constitutions weren’t built for instant, global coordination.
- **Platforms act like public squares - without public safeguards.** A few companies set the rules and recourse.
- **Attention beats trust.** Outrage spreads; nuance stalls.
- **Participation is hard.** Jargon and gatekeeping keep most people out.
- **Good ideas die in threads.** We lack a clear path from **voice → draft → decision → action → accountability**.

**The CC’s promise:** a shared, evolvable framework that communities can adopt, adapt, and audit.

---

## What the CC is

- A **set of shared declarations** (promises, protocols, and rights) for how we listen, decide, and act - together.
- A **practical playbook** (patterns, templates, guardrails) any community can reuse.
- A **living document**: updated like good software - proposed, reviewed, improved **in the open**.

## From idea to impact (at a glance)

**voice → draft → review → decision → action → accountability**

Start with an [Idea Issue](../../issues/new?template=idea.yml) *(template link todo)*  -  or ask your AI to open one using our [RepoAccelerator](./admin/tools/repo-accelerator/README.md) *(todo)*. When ready, open a **post** (pull request). That’s it. The rest you’ll learn as you go.

*Details later:* see [Process Overview](./docs/process/OVERVIEW.md) *(todo)*.


## Join in (no expertise needed)

**Bring your AI.** Seed it with [RepoAccelerator](./admin/tools/repo-accelerator/README.md) *(todo)* and ask it to draft issues or posts with you.


**2 minutes  -  Say hi**
Open **Issues → New** → title: “Hello CoCivium™”. One line about what you care about - locally or online.
*Or ask your AI to open it for you using our template.*

**10 minutes  -  Share an idea**
Open an **Idea Issue** with a clear problem and a smallest useful change.
*Ask your AI to generate it from a paragraph of notes.*

**30–60 minutes  -  Start a post (PR)**
Edit a page that needs love or add a note under `/proposals/`. Submit a **post**.
*Ask your AI to turn your issue into a PR and fill the template.*

**Everything stays reversible.** Small steps, merged often.

## The “Two Eyes” model (citizen × system)

We design governance that sees with **two eyes**:
- **Eye 1: Citizens**  -  lived experience, local context, moral intuitions.
- **Eye 2: Systems**  -  data, constraints, impact analysis, safety.

Together they give us **depth perception** - humane and workable decisions.
