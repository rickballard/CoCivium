# What feels wrong (short theory)

Most people feel the same three frictions.

1. **Truth drifts.** Important facts go stale or bend to power. People waste time and money on broken info.
2. **Help is far.** Care is scattered. When you need it, you hunt, wait, and repeat the hunt tomorrow.
3. **Voices don’t land.** Lived experience rarely becomes a fix others can reuse. Lessons leak away.

A place can change this if it learns in public.

- Small checks **update the truth** in the open.
- Fast, safe pilots **move help closer** to the person.
- Short receipts and tiny kits **turn voices into assets** that travel.

That is the theory. The practice is below.
