# How CoCivium mitigates it (practice)

**Pattern 1 — Keep truth fresh**  
- Tiny checks (tap once, photo, plain words) fix hours, prices, access rules, and contact details.
- AIs file summaries; partners sync daily.  
- **Receipts published** so others can copy the steps.

**Pattern 2 — Move help closer**  
- Prefer **safe-to-try pilots** over big bets.  
- Small credits thank helpers.  
- When a pilot works, we publish a **small kit** to repeat it elsewhere.

**Pattern 3 — Turn voices into assets**  
- Short stories and observations become **reusable checklists**.  
- Contributors are named (or aliased) and thanked.  
- Kits live in the repo so other places can adapt them.

### See it working
- Front door stories → `README.md`  
- First hour → `docs/quickstart.md`  
- Longer story → `docs/insights/the-longer-story.md`

### Trust and safety we keep
- Receipts by default.  
- Reversible moves first.  
- Independent eyes early.

> If you want to add a local fix, start with your first hour. If it helps, write a tiny kit so the next family doesn’t start from zero.
