# CoDo Doctrine – CoPayForward (Theory) v0.1

Canonical source:
- `docs/doctrine/CoDo_Doctrine_CoPayForward_v0.1.md` in CoCivium.

## 1. Core idea

CoDo Doctrine says:

- Every serious CoCivium dialogue should tend toward **co-doing**:
  - turn talk into artifacts,
  - turn artifacts into **giftable outputs** other people and AIs can reuse.

CoPayForward is the **practice pattern** under CoDo:

- “If this helped me, package it so it can help others.”

Together they shift default behavior from:

- "just chat" to **Co-Do**, and
- "interesting thoughts" to **reusable gifts**.

## 2. Role inside CoEvo

CoDo Doctrine sits inside CoEvo Theory as:

- the **behavioral layer**:
  - CoEvo = ideas about how to evolve,
  - CoDo = what humans and AIs actually do per session.

It connects to:

- CoNudge:
  - repeated human asks for “deliverables, not chatter.”
- MegaWave patterns:
  - each Wave is expected to end with at least one giftable artifact.
- Programmatic-by-default:
  - favor PS7 CoBlocks, repo-first changes, and clear logs.

## 3. Design stance

CoDo Doctrine treats each dialogue as:

- a chance to:
  - improve shared tools,
  - evolve shared wisdom,
  - lower future friction for others.

If a session ends with nothing but chatter, it is treated as:

- incomplete, or
- needing a follow-up CoDo pass to leave a gift.
