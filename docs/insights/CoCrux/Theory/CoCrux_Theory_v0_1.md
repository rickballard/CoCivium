# CoCrux Theory v0.1

> CoCrux = the minimal, non negotiable collection of guardrails, BPOE standards, and ontological anchors that keep CoCivium aligned and evolvable.

## 1. Definition

CoCrux is the conceptual bundle of:

- BPOE (Best Practice Operating Environment) rules.
- Guardrail collections (ethics, safety, edge control).
- Ontology roots (CoOntos, CC, CoPre, CoMeta, CoPotential).
- CoAnchor BPOE rails that connect sessions to repos.

If it is not in CoCrux, it is optional.  
If it is in CoCrux, it must be present and discoverable on repo.

## 2. Relationship to other concepts

- **CoEdgeRails**:
  - The slice of CoCrux focused on edge controlled power and guardrails.
  - Covers how individuals and communities own and steer their AI guardrails.

- **CoAnchor BPOE rails**:
  - Concrete PS7 and prompt rails that implement CoCrux at session level.
  - For example: CoSync, MegaWave only, Repo first, and GIBindex updates.

- **Cognocarta Consenti (CC)**:
  - The human facing megascroll that expresses CoCrux values and rights.
  - CoCrux is the distilled core of CC that must survive any refactor.

- **CoGibberCC**:
  - Machine friendly encoding of CC and CoCrux.
  - Used by CoPre and other runtime systems.

- **CoPre**:
  - The runtime interpreter that injects CoCrux into every wave.
  - Reads CC, CoGibberCC, CoOntos, and CoMeta schemas.

## 3. Why CoCrux matters to CoCivium

- Stability under change:
  - Repos, sessions, vendors, and models will change.
  - CoCrux is the small invariant set that must not be lost.

- Edge balanced stability:
  - CoCrux encodes the principles that keep power distributed toward edges, not central platforms.

- Auto evolution:
  - CoCrux defines which rails are allowed to evolve and which must remain stable.
  - It allows CoCivium to grow without losing its identity.

## 4. CoCrux and CoPotential

- CoCrux is not static law; it is a scaffold for CoPotential.
- CoPotential (evolution capacity) should not be maximized blindly.
- CoCrux expresses:
  - Which kinds of evolution are encouraged (repair, amplify, pay it forward).
  - Which kinds are forbidden (coercive, extractive, destructive).

## 5. Versioning

This is a sandbox theory document for CoCrux v0.1.

- Future versions must:
  - Live under CoCivium/docs/insights.
  - Be mirrored in:
    - CC (human text)
    - CoGibberCC (GIB spec)
    - CoOntos and CoMeta schemas.
