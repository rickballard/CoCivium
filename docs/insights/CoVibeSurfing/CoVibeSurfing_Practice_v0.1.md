CoVibeSurfing practice v0.1

This file will collect concrete patterns and scripts that make CoVibeSurfing real.

Starter checklist:
Use the CoBlock header format in all new CoSuite PS7 blocks.

Group related CoBlocks into clearly named CoSets and reference them in session notes.

Treat each MegaWave as a surf report:

which repos were involved,

what changed,

what CoStatusCloud and CoStatusLocal looked like before and after.

Future waves should add:

examples from live sessions,

diagrams that show waves and sets over time,

heuristics for when to stop a wave and start a new one.
