CoVibeSurfing theory v0.1

CoVibeSurfing is CoCivium''s framing of VibeSurfing for hybrid human plus AI work.

Core idea

Workflows feel more like surfing than like filling out forms.

AIs help shape BPOE so that good waves are easy to catch.

Humans choose which waves to ride and when to rest.

Mapping to CoSuite

CoBlocks and DO blocks are paddling strokes.

CoSets are wave sets aligned on one intent.

CoWaves are the waves that actually change repos.

MegaWaves are deliberate heavy waves that test the limits of BPOE, capacity and CoBloat.

Design goals

Reduce cognitive friction for non technical collaborators.

Make it easy to tell when a wave is starting, when it is peaking and when it has landed.

Keep the link from metaphor back to precise doctrine: CoPermanence, CoStatusCloud, CoStatusLocal and CoStyle.
