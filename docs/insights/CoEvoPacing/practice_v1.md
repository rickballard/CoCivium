# CoEvoPacing – Practice (v1)

## 1. Simple pacing checklist for sessions

When proposing or applying changes, sessions can ask:

1. Can current stewards reasonably track this change?
2. Do we have enough documentation on repo for others to follow?
3. Will this destabilise existing products or promises?
4. Are there external rails (law, contracts, partners) we might outpace?
5. Is there a safer way to stage this (feature flags, beta rails, drafts)?

If 3 or more answers are “no” or “not yet”, slow the pacing:

- limit scope of the change,
- move some work into a draft or insights file,
- schedule explicit CoSync notes for later.

## 2. CoEvoPacing levels (seed)

Sessions may tag proposals informally as:

- **P1 – Gentle**:
  - documentation only,
  - optional rails,
  - low surprise.
- **P2 – Steady**:
  - typical CoCivium evolution rate,
  - clear CoSync notes,
  - minor retraining for contributors.
- **P3 – Aggressive**:
  - significant rail changes,
  - multiple repos impact,
  - needs explicit Co1 and legal awareness.
- **P4 – Experimental**:
  - sandboxes, branches, or parallel prototypes,
  - not for default users,
  - requires explicit steward sponsorship.

These are guidance signals, not hard rules.

## 3. Hooks for future tools

Future CoHealth / CoStatus dashboards could:

- surface CoEvoPacing tags for recent changes,
- show when many P3/P4 changes are landing at once,
- recommend:
  - a “documentation sprint”,
  - a “stabilisation wave”,
  - or a temporary CoEvo slowdown.
