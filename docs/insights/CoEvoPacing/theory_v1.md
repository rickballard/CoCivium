## 1. Concept

**CoEvoPacing** asks:

> How fast should we evolve CoCivium and related systems relative to:
> - human comprehension,
> - environmental constraints,
> - and external risk?

Too little evolution:

- stagnation,
- missed opportunities,
- shrinking relevance.

Too much evolution, too fast:

- confused stewards and contributors,
- fragile rails that change faster than people can follow,
- misalignment with legal, social, and economic realities.

CoEvoPacing is about **tuning the slope** of change, not just maximising it.

---

## 2. Relationship to CoMetaEvolution

CoMetaEvolution decides **what** kinds of change are desirable and safe.

CoEvoPacing decides **how quickly** those changes should be applied and
propagated across:

- repos,
- products,
- organisations,
- culture.

They are related but distinct lenses.

## 3. Law of diminishing and compounding returns

There is a curve where:

- additional change produces diminishing returns if:
  - understanding does not keep up,
  - environment cannot absorb it,
  - or dependencies are unstable.

But there is also **compounding benefit** if:

- input criteria and rails co-evolve,
- stewards stay in sync,
- communication keeps pace with implementation.

CoEvoPacing explores where we are on that curve for any given domain.
