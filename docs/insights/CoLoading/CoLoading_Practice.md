# CoLoading – Practice

This file documents concrete patterns, scripts, and checklists for CoLoading:
- wave scaffold scripts (for example Thesis_DrB_NewWave_v1);
- examples of CoBus notices that reference multiple overlapping waves;
- do and do-not examples for future sessions.

Keep this grounded in real repo usage and CoRetro evidence.
