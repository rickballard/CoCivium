# CoLoading – Theory

CoLoading is the practice of preparing future waves of work while current waves
are still landing, under strict BPOE rails so that:
- repos remain the single source of truth;
- proofs-of-done are never faked or assumed;
- human cognitive load is reduced by keeping next steps pre-scaffolded.

This file should grow with:
- rationale for overlapping waves;
- risk analysis (for example confusion of state, race conditions);
- links to examples in DrB and other projects.
