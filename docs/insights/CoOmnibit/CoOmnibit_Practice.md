# CoOmnibit – Practice

Today we cannot implement "true" CoOmnibits, but we can approximate them with
bundles of:

- embeddings and other vector encodings;
- identity and provenance metadata;
- halo and civar state (for example trust and ethics scores);
- CoGibber keys and routing hints.

This file should capture practical patterns such as:

- how one logical CoOmnibit is represented as a tuple of
  (embedding, metadata, halo, gibber key) in current systems;
- how CoOmnibit-like records are stored, indexed, and audited in CoCivium;
- examples from live repos as they emerge.
