# CoOmnibit – Theory

A **CoOmnibit** is a conceptual generalisation of the classical bit and the
quantum bit into an omni-dimensional state carrier.

- Bit: 2 discrete states (0 or 1).
- Qubit: state over 2 basis vectors in a complex vector space.
- **CoOmnibit**: an abstract unit that can carry arbitrarily many state axes
  at once (for example semantics, trust, ethics, provenance, routing) under a
  single addressable identity.

In CoCivium, CoOmnibits act as the imagined primitive for future compute and
storage regimes where "one unit" of information is not a single number but a
rich manifold of meaning and governance-relevant attributes.

This file should grow with:

- connections to quantum, neuromorphic, and symbolic compute;
- discussion of how CoOmnibits change governance and law (more dimensions,
  more responsibility);
- links to DrB thesis sections that rely on the CoOmnibit idea.
