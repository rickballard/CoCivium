# CoHyperbit – Theory

A CoHyperbit is a generalized "bit" whose state space is not limited to
0 or 1 but can be a vector in a high or infinite dimensional space.
This includes:
- classical bits and multivalued logic as small special cases;
- quantum qudits and continuous variable modes;
- neuromorphic and analog structures that carry rich state.

In CoCivium, CoHyperbits represent the minimal units of state that can
carry structured relational meaning. They are the building blocks for
thinking about future computation, AI cognition, and governance that
cannot be modeled as simple binary trees.

Planned sections:
- Relation to existing terms (bit, qubit, qudit, continuous variable).
- Why CoHyperbits matter for CoCivium guardrails.
- How CoHyperbits appear in CoGibber as the hyperbit primitive.
