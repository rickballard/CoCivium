# CoHyperbit – Practice

This file documents concrete uses of CoHyperbits in CoCivium:

- Examples of how embeddings and high dimensional vectors can be modeled
  as bundles of CoHyperbits.
- How CoHyperbit aware thinking changes system design for:
  - CoCache and CoCore (data and best practice stores),
  - CoAgent and CoArena (agent orchestration),
  - CoAudit (trust and halo scoring).

Hooks:
- Link to DrB thesis chapters that reason about post binary computation.
- Examples of CoGibber schemas where hyperbit is used as a primitive.
- Future diagrams: CoHyperbit space vs classical bit space.
