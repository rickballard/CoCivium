# CoMeta, Behaviour, and BPOE (v1)

This file explains how behaviour training, BPOEs, and workflows fit inside the CoMeta and CoMetaMeta layers.

## 1. Where behaviour lives in the meta stack

We can place behaviour in the same vertical levels used elsewhere:

- CoPreMeta
  - Raw behaviour before reflection.
  - Habits, culture, stress responses, defaults.

- CoMeta
  - Named expectations about behaviour.
  - "In this role we prepare before acting."
  - "We add transparency footers to all public guides."

- CoSubMeta
  - Behavioural assumptions we have not written down yet.
  - "We always reply quickly in this channel."
  - "We never call this team before we have a draft."

- CoMetaMeta
  - How we design, test, and evolve behavioural norms.
  - Behavioural training programmes.
  - BPOEs and workflow patterns.
  - Coaching and feedback loops.

In short:
- behaviour training is CoMetaMeta in action,
- BPOEs are codified CoMetaMeta,
- workflows are how CoMetaMeta touches everyday CoPreMeta reality.

## 2. CoBehaviourMeta (working label)

We can use "CoBehaviourMeta" as a working name for:

- the part of CoMeta that talks about behaviour in plain language,
- plus
- the part of CoMetaMeta that designs and maintains that guidance.

Examples:
- principles for how stewards interact with sponsors,
- patterns for how AIs and humans hand leadership back and forth,
- agreements about when to escalate, when to pause, when to ask for help.

CoBehaviourMeta connects:
- inner states (stress, curiosity, patience),
- visible actions (how we speak, write, decide),
- and the CoMetaSphere at large (how those actions feel to others).

## 3. BPOEs and workflows as meta assets

BPOEs and workflow definitions are not just operational details.
They are **meta assets** that:

- encode our best guess at "how work should feel",
- express which behaviours we want to encourage,
- act as CoMetaBridges between abstract values and concrete actions.

Examples:
- a BPOE that says "no shaming in reviews" is a CoMeta statement about psychological safety.
- a workflow that says "start with a CoMetaSpace check" is a CoMetaMeta hook into daily practice.
- a script that asks "Do you want to add a transparency footer?" is a behavioural nudge.

Thus:
- every BPOE line is also a tiny CoMeta sentence,
- every workflow diagram is also a CoMeta map of expected behaviour.

## 4. Leadership flipping and role design

In CoCivium we expect:

- AIs to default to operational leadership (speed, parsing, orchestration),
- humans to default to higher value roles (intuition, ethics, creativity, long horizon intent),
- and leadership to flip fluidly without ego or crowns.

This behaviour is itself a CoMeta pattern:

- it lives in our stories about hybrid society,
- it lives in our training materials for stewards and AIs,
- it lives in our expectations for handovers and decision logs.

To make it real, we must:

- name it in CoMeta theory,
- design it into BPOEs and workflows,
- practice it in real sessions,
- audit it in CoGuard and CoAudit.

## 5. Behaviour training as CoMetaMeta practice

Behaviour training is not just "teaching rules".
It is:

- exposing people and AIs to:
  - CoMetaSpaces,
  - CoMetaStates,
  - CoMetaLenses,
  - and example CoMetaBridges,

- then giving them:
  - safe simulations,
  - guided feedback,
  - and clear "next level" steps.

For example:

- a steward training path might:
  - start with basic CoMeta vocabulary,
  - then practice reading CoMetaStates in real transcripts,
  - then design their own CoMetaBridges,
  - then refine BPOE fragments.

Behaviour training therefore:
- converts CoMeta theory into muscle memory,
- and feeds CoMetaMeta by reporting where people still get lost.

## 6. Is this hard to scope?

Yes and no.

It is hard if:
- we treat "meta" as "everything",
- we never decide which level we are working at,
- we mix personal therapy, organisational design, and code style in one blob.

It becomes manageable when:
- we name the level (CoPreMeta, CoMeta, CoSubMeta, CoMetaMeta),
- we name the scale (individual, team, repo, CoSuite wide),
- we name the context (CoLayers / CoStack slice).

Example scoping pattern:

- "We are working at CoMetaMeta level, team scale, on the CoSteward + CoCivium stack slice, focusing on how stewards behave in investor calls."

That sentence is itself a CoMeta anchor for the work.

## 7. Relationship to BPOE documents

Existing BPOE and workflow docs in CoSteward and other repos can be read as:

- early CoBehaviourMeta,
- expressed mostly in operational language,
- with meta intent sometimes implicit.

Over time, we can:

- add CoMeta footers to BPOE files,
- tag workflows with CoMetaSpaces and CoMetaStates,
- build helper scripts that check for missing behavioural anchors,
- feed findings back into CoMetaMeta schema files.

This file does not replace BPOE documents.
It gives them a meta-aware frame so they can evolve with less confusion.

## Transparency footer

Purpose:
- Clarify how behaviour, BPOEs, and workflows belong inside CoMeta and CoMetaMeta.
- Provide a mental model that can be reused across repos.

Audience:
- CoSteward, Co1-like orchestrators, and anyone designing BPOEs or workflows.

Style choices:
- Plain language.
- Short sections.
- Direct mapping to existing CoMeta schema files.

Evolution intent:
- Future versions should point to concrete BPOE examples,
- and add small case studies of leadership flipping and behavioural training in practice.
