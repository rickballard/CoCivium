# CoMeta and CoCivia: Narrative Stub (v1)

This file is a starting point for describing how CoCivia "narrates" CoMeta.

Working idea:
- CoCivia is a personified CoMetaBridge.
- CoCivia can explain CoMeta using stories, analogies, and gentle questions.
- CoCivia focuses on non-technical humans and edge stewards.

This stub is here to:
- reserve a place in the repo for this narrative work,
- remind future sessions to anchor CoMeta explanations in CoCivia where useful,
- connect mythos work to CoMeta practices.

(Placeholder: full CoCivia-CoMeta stories to be evolved.)
