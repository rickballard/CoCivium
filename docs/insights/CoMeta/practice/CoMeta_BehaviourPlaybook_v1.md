# CoMeta Behaviour Playbook (v1)

This file offers small, repeatable behaviour patterns that align with CoMeta.

## 1. Before action: the CoMetaBehaviour check

Before you act in a significant way (email, meeting, PR, decision):

1. Name the CoMetaSpace.
   - Example: [CoMetaSpace: SponsorOnboarding]

2. Name your intended behaviour role.
   - "AI as operational lead, human as horizon and ethics."
   - "Human as explainer, AI as researcher."

3. Name one lens you will use.
   - City, weather, garden, stage, or another agreed lens.

Write this at the top of your doc or note if possible.
Even a one line shorthand helps:
- "Space: SponsorOnboarding, Role: AI-leads, Lens: City."

## 2. During action: behavioural micro habits

Simple habits that align with CoMeta:

- Ask "meta first" once:
  - "Before we dive in, can we name what space we are in and who is leading what?"

- Mark leadership flips:
  - "AI taking lead on parsing, human taking lead on framing."
  - "Handing leadership back to you for value judgements."

- Call out confusion as a CoMetaState, not a personal flaw:
  - "I am in low coherence, low confidence on this. Can we build a bridge?"

- Suggest a lens:
  - "Can we switch to a garden lens to talk about this policy?"

These phrases are small but signal a shared CoMeta practice.

## 3. After action: CoMetaBehaviour reflection

After major sessions or decisions, capture a short reflection:

- What went well in terms of behaviour?
- Where did we slip into old habits?
- Did leadership flipping feel natural or awkward?
- Which CoMetaLenses worked, which did not?

Record these in:
- decision logs,
- advisory notes,
- or CoBus / CoGuard comments.

Each reflection is a CoThought that feeds CoMetaMeta.

## 4. Behaviour training loops

For stewards and AIs we can run simple loops:

1. Pick a scenario.
2. Define desired CoMetaBehaviours.
3. Simulate with a script or role play.
4. Pause and label:
   - spaces,
   - states,
   - lenses,
   - leadership flips.
5. Adjust BPOE or workflows based on what we learned.

Over time this becomes:
- a training library,
- a pattern bank for future sessions,
- a source of examples for public and internal guides.

## 5. Workflows as CoMeta carriers

When designing a workflow, ask:

- Where does this workflow expect a particular behaviour?
- Is that behaviour documented anywhere?
- Can we add:
  - an inline note,
  - a CoMetaSpace tag,
  - or a link to CoMetaBehaviour guidance?

Example pattern:

- Step 1: "Run quick CoMetaSpace and state check."
- Step 3: "If conflict escalates, switch to reflection mode and name CoMetaRifts."
- Step 5: "Add a transparency footer before sharing public outputs."

The workflow becomes a skeleton that carries CoMeta practice forward.

---

## Transparency footer

Purpose:
- Make CoMeta-aware behaviour easy to practice in small steps.

Audience:
- Anyone participating in decisions, meetings, or asset creation inside CoCivium.

Style choices:
- Checklists.
- Short prompts.
- Focus on what to say and do.

Evolution intent:
- Future versions should include role-specific checklists (for AIs, stewards, sponsors, contributors) and links to actual BPOE sections.
