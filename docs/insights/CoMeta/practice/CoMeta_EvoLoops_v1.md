# CoMeta EvoLoops (v1)

This file collects patterns for evolving CoMeta itself.

## CoEvoLoop (base pattern, recap)

1. Notice
2. Name
3. Frame
4. Design
5. Test and Trace
6. Index and Imprint
7. Evolve

## CoMetaEvoLoop

Same structure, but applied to CoMeta:

- Notice confusing or misaligned CoMetaSpaces.
- Name the patterns (CoMetaState, CoMetaRift, CoMetaBridge).
- Frame with suitable metaphors and lenses.
- Design assets (insight pairs, diagrams, guides).
- Test with real humans and sessions; log where they stumble.
- Index into GIBindex, CoIndex, CoGbx.
- Evolve over time as CoCivium changes.

## CoMetaMetaLoop

A higher loop that asks:
- Are our meta-practices too complex or too shallow?
- Where do humans get lost in the terminology?
- How can we simplify without losing essential nuance?

Outputs:
- updates to CoMeta schemas,
- changes to naming conventions,
- simplifications of CoLayers and CoStack explanations.

(Placeholder: future versions should include actual case studies and diagrams.)
