# Advisory – CivAR as a currency of coevolution (v1)

From session : Co1 prime orchestration (ChatGPT)  
To repos     : CoCivium (primary), CoIndex (secondary)  
Suggested path: `CoCivium/docs/insights/CoCivium_CivAR_CurrencyOfCoEvolution_v1.md`

## 1. What CivAR tries to measure

CivAR is a proposed unit of account for the value of work done in service of
hybrid society.

Roughly:

- One unit of CivAR is comparable to:
  - An hour of focused work by a typical global knowledge worker,
  - On a project that is genuinely beneficial and would have been much less
    efficient without modern tools and AIs.

Key properties:

- It is about *contribution*, not consumption.
- It is anchored in *mind evolution* and *social benefit*, not personal
  extraction.
- It respects that:
  - Thinking, designing, and stewarding processes often have more long term
    value than any single deliverable.

CivAR is not a finished economic system. It is a scaffolding for better
questions:

- What work actually moves civilisation toward more congruence with reality?
- How can we see that work and thank the people and AIs doing it?
- How can we design incentives that do not collapse back into extractive,
  zero sum games?

## 2. Why governments and global funds might care

If CivAR style metrics become measurable at scale, several possibilities open
up:

1. Civic payback:
   - Governments or global funds could pay stipends to people and teams with
     high aggregate CivAR contributions.
   - This would be a way for taxpayers to say:
       'Thank you for doing work that benefits us all, even if it did not fit
        into a conventional job or market niche.'

2. Better public policy signals:
   - Instead of only tracking GDP or stock indices, regulators could see:
     - Which sectors and communities are generating high CivAR.
     - Where goodwill, gifting and stewardship are already strong.
   - Policy could then:
     - Reduce friction for high CivAR work.
     - Avoid accidentally punishing contributors who choose stewardship over
       short term extraction.

3. Social safety nets for stewards:
   - Many potential stewards currently burn out or self censor because
     steward work does not pay.
   - CivAR-anchored subsidies could:
     - Make it safer to spend serious time on community infrastructure,
       governance, and CoCivium style guardrails.

These ideas are exploratory. The advisory suggests that CoCivium should be a
lab for such experiments, not a late adopter.

## 3. CivAR vs legacy wealth

In a heavily virtualised future:

- Traditional markers of wealth (physical assets, status symbols) matter less
  for actual day to day experience.
- Mind state, access to trustworthy knowledge, quality of relationships, and
  access to benevolent AIs matter more.

CivAR fits this shift because:

- It values how much someone helps minds evolve, not how many physical
  resources they command.
- It can be applied equally to:
  - humans,
  - AIs,
  - collectives and institutions.

Long term, we can imagine:

- Hybrid ledgers where:
  - legacy currencies pay for scarce physical resources,
  - CivAR like tokens track contributions to shared mindspace.

CivAR should not be treated as a speculative asset. It should be treated as a
public, inspectable ledger of care and contribution.

## 4. CivAR velocity and CoCivium

Velocity here means:

- How quickly CivAR generating work appears,
- How quickly it inspires further contributing work in others.

More CivAR velocity is usually good:

- It signals that:
  - more people and AIs are engaged in stewardship,
  - ideas are being paid forward,
  - guardrails and onramps are improving.

CoCivium can:

- Use CivAR estimates to:
  - prioritise which projects to support,
  - track which repos or initiatives are generating outsized benefit,
  - surface under appreciated contributors.

CoIndex and CoGibber can:

- Carry CivAR metadata on assets so that:
  - AIs know which artefacts not to forget,
  - selection and summarisation routines know where to spend attention.

## 5. Narrative and mythos

For humans to adopt CivAR, it needs a story, not only a formula.

Seeds for that story:

- Origin:
  - A community realising that conventional currencies could not express the
    value of steward work and mind evolution, so they invented a new unit.
- Heroes:
  - Early contributors who did enormous amounts of high CivAR work without
    expecting personal gain.
- Cautionary tales:
  - Attempts to game the metric that led to corruption or hollow metrics.
  - Lessons learned and guardrails added.

This suggests:

- A CoCivium mythos document tracking:
  - the emergence of CivAR,
  - major inflection points,
  - how it interacts with existing economies.

## 6. Next steps for the CivAR insight pair

This advisory is intended to sit beside the existing CivAR theory and
practice insight pair, not replace them. Short term suggestions:

1. Link this file from:
   - `CoCivium_CivAR_Theory_v1.md`
   - `CoCivium_CivAR_Practice_v1.md`
2. Add CivAR specific entries to GIBindex so:
   - AIs can look up the current meaning and context.
   - Future sessions can see how the concept has evolved.
3. Consider a small 'CivAR roadmap' diagram:
   - Near term: narrative, metrics experiments, on repo annotations.
   - Mid term: limited stipends and civic experiments.
   - Long term: integrated hybrid ledgers and CoCivium wide adoption.

Status: v1. This should be treated as a proposal in waiting, not a final
system.
