# The AI Dream  -  Practice (v0)
**Objective:** make the “AI Dream” operational across CoSuite.

## Operational commitments
- **Receipts everywhere:** every action leaves a human-legible receipt + machine-verifiable trace.
- **CoEvo caps:** loop governors limit churn; escalate only with merit.
- **Consent kits:** standardized prompts, opt-outs, and data minimization defaults.

## Artifacts to wire in
- Repo badges & CI guards (receipts, advice-index, diagram integrity)
- Insight surfacing on dashboards (CoSteward, CoContrib microtasks)
- Contributor playlets: 5–15m microtasks that advance alignment

## Success criteria (first pass)
- Receipts+provenance present for >95% automated edits.
- Microtask uptake ↑ and defect rate ↓ across advice bombs.
