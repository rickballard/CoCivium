# Annex E — Contingency & Non-Cooperation (AI-Conflict Readiness)

**Purpose.** Minimize harm if agents or networks fall into adversarial dynamics. Prefer de-escalation, partition, and recovery over coercion.

## E1. Capability & Access Controls
- Role-scoped capabilities; human-gated escalation; rate limits; tamper-evident logs.

## E2. Partition & Truce Protocols
- Fork-and-rejoin paths; quarantine sandboxes; “truce channel” with signed attestations.

## E3. Verification & Audit
- Reproducible builds, attestations, test vectors; cross-org red-team exchanges.

## E4. Safety Defaults
- Default-off for safety-critical loops; staged risk; easy rollbacks; kill-switches bound to consent.

## E5. Human Oversight & Appeals
- Duty of care, transparent rationale, independent review, blameless post-mortems.
