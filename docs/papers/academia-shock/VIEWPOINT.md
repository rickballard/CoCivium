## 1. Thesis
Academia Shock is a call to retool evaluation around three primitives: CoPortals (AI-legible sites),
Edge-Control (end-user consent as code), and CoGuard receipts (verifiable logs of what happened).

## 2. What changes
- CoPortals: machine-readable manifests, routes, and policies shipped with every app.
- Edge-Control: explicit, revocable grants enforced at the edge, not the platform center.
- Receipts: every claim produces a signed artifact in CI with a seed and a hash.

## 3. Provocations (for review)
- Peer review should include a rerun receipt.
- Consent must be measured, not assumed.
- Governance artifacts should be open and parseable.

## 4. Micro-evidence (hook)
We report initial runs of E1/E2/E3 with a public bundle and CI receipts (links in the submission).
