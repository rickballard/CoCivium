# Methods & Benchmark (E-series)
- E1: CoPortal fidelity vs human-face pages (task success, token cost, wrong-state actions)
- E2: Consent clarity under Edge-Control (blocked reads vs attempted disallowed actions)
- E3: Trust visibility with receipts (reproducibility rate, anomaly time-to-detection)

Each experiment ships: data stub, config, fixed seeds, and expected receipts.
