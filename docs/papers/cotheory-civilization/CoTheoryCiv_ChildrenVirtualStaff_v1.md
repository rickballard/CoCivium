Focus: future of youth, education and power.

2. Risks: gaming systems, destabilising communities, captured by platforms.
3. CoScendence as a training goal for young people.
4. CoCivium guardrails for youth (education, CoGuard, CoPolitic).
5. Pathways for youth to earn civars and halo, not just attention.
