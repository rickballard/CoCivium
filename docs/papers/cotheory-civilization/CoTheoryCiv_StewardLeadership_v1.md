Focus: human interest and leadership.

Draft sections:

1. Late stage capitalism and elites trapped in their own end game.
2. Definition of a Steward vs a CEO.
3. How stewards wield "armies of virtual staffers" without becoming tyrants.
4. Merit, civars and paying it forward into CoCivium.
5. Case study vignettes (fictional but plausible).
