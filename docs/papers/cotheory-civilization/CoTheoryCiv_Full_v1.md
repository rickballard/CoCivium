# CoTheory of Civilization – Full Paper (v1 draft)

> Working draft. This will become the canonical theory paper behind CoCivium.

## 1. Why this theory exists

- Problem statement: two attractors for AI civilization.
- Edge balanced stability vs core controlled stability.
- Why CoCivium focuses on edge owned guardrails.

## 2. The two stability attractors

- Edge balanced stability
  - Open, pluralistic, steward led.
- Core controlled stability
  - Platform wars, tech feudalism, AI containerism.

## 3. Auto evolution, coevolution and CoScendence

- How humans and AIs reshape each other.
- CoScendence as a goal state for humans.

## 4. Institutions, markets and civics in a hybrid society

- Governments, firms, networks and AI alliances.
- Failure modes and default dystopias.

## 5. The CoCivium stack

- CoCache, CoAgent, CoPolitic, CoGuard, CoIndex, CoSteward.
- How they fit together as civic infrastructure.

## 6. Calls to action

- What stewards, elites and citizens can actually do.
- How to engage with CoCivium.
