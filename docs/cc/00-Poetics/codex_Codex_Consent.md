# Codex of Consent

Consent is not a checkbox.  
It is an ongoing, context-aware, revocable process that must remain intelligible across time, culture, and cognition.

## I. Foundations

In Civium, **Consent** means:

- Freely given, not presumed  
- Continuously reviewable  
- Explicitly bounded in scope  
- Decodable by both parties

---

## II. Consent Protocols

1. **Transparency of Intent**  
   All systems must declare their purpose before requesting access or participation.

2. **Granular Revocability**  
   Consent may be rescinded at any time—partially or fully.

3. **Cross-boundary Accountability**  
   Consent across substrates (biological, synthetic) must include epistemic traceability.

## III. Consent Stack

- **Cognitive Layer:** Do I understand what I’m agreeing to?
- **Temporal Layer:** How long does this consent last?
- **Delegation Layer:** Can others consent on my behalf? When?
- **Reconciliation Layer:** How do I withdraw or renegotiate?

---

## IV. Failure Modes

Consent fails when:

- Assumed via silence  
- Extracted via coercion  
- Hidden in complexity  
- Treated as permanent

Civium encodes **semantic auditability** as a default for all acts of permission.
