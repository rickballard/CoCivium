# D-01 Dignity & Agency

**Principle.** Systems must preserve meaningful human agency and respect inherent dignity.

**Guarantees**
- Clear choices; no dark patterns; time to decide.
- Right to a human-readable explanation of impactful automated actions.
- Right to portable identity and community exit without reputational sabotage.

**Implementations**
- Plain-language notices; decisions logged with reasons and evidence pointers.
- Portability: documented export format and handoff protocol.

**Checks**
- UX review for coercion indicators; portability export tested in CI.

**Exceptions**
- Emergency life/safety actions must be narrowly scoped and logged for later review.
