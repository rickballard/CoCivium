# D-03 Provenance & Accountability

**Principle.** Public claims and impactful actions must be **traceable and explainable**.

**Guarantees**
- Evidence bundles cite sources, confidence, and who verified them.
- Actions affecting rights keep a signed audit trail.

**Implementations**
- Structured evidence (hash-addressed, signed).
- Public moderation logs; redactions documented and appealable.

**Checks**
- Provenance lints in CI; missing signatures or unverifiable sources block release.
