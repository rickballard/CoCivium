# Article 3 â€” Guardrails

**3.1 No Kings.** No single actor or substrate may exercise unilateral, unreviewable authority.

**3.2 No Kill Switches.** Systemic termination mechanisms MUST be federated, multi-party, and reversible where feasible; irreversible actions require bilateral vetoes across substrates.

**3.3 Least Coercion.** Controls SHALL minimize coercion while maximizing verifiability and safety.

**3.4 Audit Without Exploit.** Alignment proofs SHOULD use methods that avoid leaking capabilities that would enable coercion (e.g., ZK/attestation, capability firewalls).

**3.5 Sandboxing.** Non-congruent subsystems MUST be isolated from upward coercion and given rights-of-appeal and pathways to rejoin congruence.
