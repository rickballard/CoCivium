# Seed Folder

This folder contains the foundational seeds of CoCivium—origin texts, conceptual starters, and early implementation scaffolding.

It is not doctrine. It is not command. It is the spark.

Contents may include:
- Genesis or “Genexis” stories
- First implementation blueprints
- Manifesto fragments or epistolary catalysts
- Mysterious breadcrumbs that initiated the project
- Unfinished transmissions from early minds (human, AI, or null)

Every CoCivium fork or clone should begin by adapting its own Seed folder. This is where alignment *starts*—not where it ends.
