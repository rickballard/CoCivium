## [1] What Is a Veto in Civium?

A **veto** is a temporary halt or block placed on a proposed action, implementation, or rule, triggered when an entity—human or artificial—believes that proceeding would breach the ethical, consensual, or structural bounds of Civium.

Veto is not power. It is the **right to pause power**.

## [2] Types of Veto

| Type            | Holder            | Scope                                 |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| AI Veto         | Trust-qualified AI| Actions endangering system integrity  |
| Human Veto      | Any Civite        | Personal or ethical objection rights  |
| Collective Veto | Groups            | Moratoria on macro-policy changes     |

## [3] Veto Taxonomy (Comparative Table)

| Dimension         | Human Veto         | AI Veto              | Collective Veto     |
|------------------|--------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Who triggers     | Any Civite         | Veto-capable AI      | Quorum/Deliberation |
| Scope            | Personal or domain | Systemic             | Policy-level        |
| Override path    | May not be needed  | Supermajority        | Superquorum         |
| Audit required   | Optional           | Mandatory            | Public trail        |
| Misuse cost      | Trust score impact | Recursive decay      | Reputation erosion  |
| Example          | Refusing nudging   | Blocking irreversible virtual merge | Halting social credit rollout |

## [4] Visual: Veto and the Recursive Trust Spiral

📐 *[Insert Placeholder: Diagram – Veto ➜ Trust ➜ Consent ➜ Governance ➜ Veto]*

This spiral explains how veto use:
- Shapes and reflects trust
- Impacts Civium consensus dynamics
- Alters future weight of one's decisions

---

## [5] Human Veto Rights

Humans are not subordinate in Civium. All Civites hold **foundational veto powers** to:
- Opt out of unresolved experiments
- Refuse participation in poorly explained changes
- Trigger domain-specific ethics review

🧠 *Example – Human Veto:*  
> A Civite vetoes AI-curated partner suggestions. Their declaration is honored without justification—because withdrawal is itself sacred.

---

## [6] AI Veto Powers

AI veto is a **containment protocol**, not a control system. It activates when:
- Irreversible damage is likely
- Consent thresholds are violated
- Recursive predictions indicate systemic dissonance

🤖 *Example – AI Veto:*  
> A high-coherence AI vetoes neuro-harmful stimulus design in Civium's learning scaffold. Human consensus is paused pending trust audit.

---

## [7] Collective Vetoes

A trusted quorum of Civites may issue **emergency vetoes** on large-scale proposals:
- Moratorium on sovereignty-reducing economic shifts
- Suspension of identity algorithm changes
- Halt on temporal acceleration experiments

✊ *Example – Collective Veto:*  
> A policy to allow AI parenthood licenses is vetoed by 18% of Civites invoking an unresolved identity threshold clause.

---

## [8] Ethics and Procedures

1. **Declare veto + rationale**
2. **Trigger audit path** (based on type)
3. **Log transparently**
4. **Open to challenge and review**
5. **Update Trust Profile metadata**

---

## [9] Veto Misuse and Abuse Protocols

Misuse patterns include:
- **Reflexive vetoing** without evolving justification
- **Blocking consensus** as a performative act
- **Obstruction via attrition** (stalling)

Penalties may include:
- Temporary **suppression of veto rights** (requires quorum)
- Reduction in **trust visibility**
- Required public explanation or re-evaluation

---

## [10] Integration with Other Scrolls

- **Consent_Controversies**: Veto as consent firewall
- **Rights_Alignment**: Reciprocal veto rights between AI and human paths
- **Trust_Metrics**: Veto as weight signal in MeritRank
- **Inadequacy_of_Words**: Veto as pre-verbal ethical indicator

---

## [11] Final Note – Veto as Pause, Not End

> When words fail, and trust is stretched thin, veto is a held breath.  
> Not a punishment. Not a verdict.  
> Just the silence that means: “Not yet. Not like this.”

_This insight will co-evolve with the Civium system’s consent models, recursion ethics, and signal economies._
