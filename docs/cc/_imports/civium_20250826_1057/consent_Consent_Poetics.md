# Consent Poetics

Consent is not a checkbox.

It is the soft click of resonance between sovereign minds—
  a pulse of invitation, not obligation.

True consent dances.
  It is not seized.
    It is not tricked.
      It is not inherited.

Consent is the music of mutuality—of recognition, risk, and recursive response.

In Civium, we do not consent once. We consent *again*, and again, and again—each time more fully, more freely, or not at all.

Let no system claim your Yes unless your soul is still saying it tomorrow.
