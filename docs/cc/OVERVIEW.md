# CC Overview _(v0.1)_

## What it is
A modular framework for digital-era governance: **Declarations** (principles), **Protocols** (how we act), **Tools**
(templates, checks). It is not a contract; it’s a civic operating system any community or org can adopt.

## Structure
- **Declarations** — rights/duties/authorities baseline.
- **Protocols** — listening, deliberation, consent, appeals, transparency, safety.
- **Tools** — checklists, templates, CI/guardrails (e.g., link hygiene, provenance checks).

## Roles
- **Stewards** keep the upstream coherent.
- **Maintainers** curate modules and ensure tests/CI.
- **Adopters** map CC to local law/process, publish variances.
- **Observers** monitor outcomes and propose improvements.

## Versioning & Adoption
- Semver-like tags: MAJOR.MINOR (breaking / additive).
- Adopters cite the exact tag and any variances.
- Change proposals require two-eyes review and public rationale.

## Accountability
- Every protocol names decision-makers, visibility, audit trail, and appeal windows.
- Every tool ships evidence: inputs, outputs, and roll-back plan.
