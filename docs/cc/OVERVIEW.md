# CC Overview (v0.1)

**What is CC?** A shared framework for how we **listen, decide, and act** together, online/offline.

**How it changes:** Like software. Anyone may propose; changes are reviewed in public and shipped in small, reversible steps.

**How to adopt:** Start with the core declarations, then layer local addenda. Keep diffs trackable.

**Two Eyes lens:** Citizen (lived experience) × System (constraints & safety) for depth perception in decisions.

**Where to start:**
- Read the [Declarations Index](./DECLARATIONS.md).
- Open an Idea Issue for improvements.
- Start a “post” (PR) with the smallest useful change.
