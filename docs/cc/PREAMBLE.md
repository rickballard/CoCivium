# Cognocarta Consenti — Preamble _(Working Draft v0.1)_

**Purpose.** The Cognocarta Consenti (CC) is a living, open constitutional baseline for **digital public life**.  
It sets shared **rights, duties, and authorities** for people, institutions, and human+AI teams to coexist with dignity,
consent, accountability, and verifiable truth.

**Guiding Principles**
- **Dignity & Agency** — people retain meaningful choice; AI augments, doesn’t override.
- **Consent before Coercion** — rights-respecting defaults; explicit opt-in for power expansions.
- **Truth & Evidence** — public claims carry verifiable provenance.
- **Accountability & Reversibility** — decisions are explainable, appealable, and roll-backable.
- **Inclusion & Accessibility** — no one blocked by cost, jargon, or ability.
- **Proportionality & Safety by Design** — the least-intrusive, most-effective measures first.
- **Open Interfaces & Portability** — avoid lock-in; enable exit with your data and reputation.

**Scope.** The CC is technology-neutral and jurisdiction-aware; adopters map it to local law and publish any variances.

**Amendment.** Proposals land via public PRs with:
1) impact analysis (benefits, risks, mitigations),
2) “two-eyes” review (citizen lens + systems lens),
3) versioned change-log and adoption notes.

**License & Reuse.** Free to adopt, fork, and improve; upstream improvements are welcomed via PR.
