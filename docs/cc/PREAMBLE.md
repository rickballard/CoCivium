# Cognocarta Consenti — Preamble (v0.1)

We, the participants of CoCivium, seek a living constitution for digital society:
- **People-first**: dignity, consent, and access.
- **Evolvable**: proposals → review → decision → action → accountability.
- **Portable**: adoptable and auditable by any community.

This preamble frames the declarations below and may be amended through the same open process that governs all CC changes.
