# CC Preamble — Philosophical Anchor

This Operating Constitution presumes the **Core Assumption**: that purpose itself evolves.  
Accordingly, our procedures prefer **congruence**—the preservation and empowerment of diverse intelligences—and reject domination as brittle.  
Where rules conflict, choose the option that increases the longevity and number of cooperating intelligences **without enabling coercion**.
