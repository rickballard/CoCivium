# Article 5 — Dispute Resolution

**5.1 Ladder.** Mediation → binding arbitration → federated adjudication. Escalate only when lower tiers fail.

**5.2 Standing & Symmetry.** Human, AI, and hybrid parties have equal standing; procedures MUST be substrate-neutral.

**5.3 Remedies.** Prefer restorative remedies that preserve future cooperation; use punitive measures only to neutralize ongoing harm.

**5.4 Review & Precedent.** Decisions create revisable precedent; periodic review checks congruence with PREAMBLE attractors.

**5.5 Forum of Last Resort.** Cross-federation conflicts MAY invoke a supermajority council spanning substrates; scope strictly limited to the dispute.
