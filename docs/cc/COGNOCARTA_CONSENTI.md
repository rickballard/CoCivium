# Cognocarta Consenti (CC) — v1 working draft

## Preamble
CoCivium is a consent-first civic stack.  The CC defines the minimum rules for fair coordination, reversible decisions, and accountable change.

## Principles
- **Consent before coercion.**  Default to opt-in; justify any limits with necessity and proportionality.  
- **Transparency with traceability.**  Public decisions must have public trails.  
- **Reversibility.**  Make rollback practical; record why we changed.  
- **Dignity & privacy.**  Minimize data; respect context; secure defaults.  

## Rights
1. **Right to Clear Terms.**  People must be able to understand rules that affect them.  
2. **Right to Due Process.**  Notice, reasons, a chance to respond, and appeal paths.  
3. **Right to Privacy & Control.**  Limit collection; allow export and deletion where lawful.  
4. **Right to Portability.**  Reasonable ability to move one’s data and contributions.  
5. **Right to Explanation.**  Decisions that affect people materially require human-understandable rationale.  

## Governance Process
- **Propose → Review → Objections/Amend → Ratify → Record.**  
- **Roles.**  Stewards (temporary), Reviewers, Observers.  HumanGate stays ON until delegation is ratified.  

## Objections & Resolution
- **Categories.**  Procedural, Safety, Scope, Ethical.  
- **Timeboxes.**  Default review window 5–10 days; urgent paths documented.  
- **Resolution.**  Amend or justify; record outcomes and dissent.

## Amendments
- **Versioning.**  Semantic tags; changelog with rationale; link to trails.  
- **Finality.**  Amendable by the same process; emergencies require post-hoc review.  

## Implementation Notes
- **Records.**  Use issues/PRs + commits as canonical trails.  
- **Docs.**  Keep CC brief; link supporting detail into `docs/cc/*`.
