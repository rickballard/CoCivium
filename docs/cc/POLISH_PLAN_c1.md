# CC Polish Plan (c1)
> *Beauty.*  We tune CC to be coherent, legible, and brand-consistent.

**Purpose.** Track concrete edits to bring CC up to Brand Pattern v2 and NAV map.

## Tasks
- Apply **BrandLead_v2** lead/footer structure to CC root.
- Normalize headings, callouts, and quote blocks.
- Cross-link CC Hub â†’ NAVMAP and public policy index.
- Run link/lint passes; fix anchors.

**Coevolution Call.** Edit this list aggressively; PRs welcome.
