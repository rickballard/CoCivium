# OpenAI Partner Pitch — CoAgent as Safety & Control Plane
**Problem:** Chat ↔ shell workflows risk unsafe ops + brittle context.
**Solution:** CoAgent provides explicit handshakes, repo-stored policies, session-only triggers, demark/telemetry.
**Integration:** GPT with Actions calls CoAgent API; no profile writes; wash-away hooks.
**Benefit:** higher user trust, lower risk, clear audit trail.
