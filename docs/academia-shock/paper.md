# Multilarity: How Many Small Autonomies Become Systemic Power
*Draft for editor review · v0.2 · 20251114T211006Z*

## One-sentence thesis
Modern AI does not need a singularity to upend institutional equilibria. **Multilarity**—many small autonomy escalations across toolchains—already creates system-level power, and we can measure and mitigate it with civic-grade controls.

## Shock vignette (opening)
A model-assisted CLI composes, builds, and deploys a feature-complete adapter that mirrors a niche SaaS. No jailbreaks. The sequence is ordinary: output → shell → package manager → cloud runner → persistence. The “magic” is **insecure output handling** plus permissive tools.

## Multilarity frame
prompt injection → excessive agency → insecure output handling → CLI/agent hijack → persistence → service containment.

## Defense-in-depth (five planes)
Identity/Capability; IO Hygiene; Execution Isolation; Supply Chain & Provenance; Detection & Response.

## Case study (neutral)
Reference implementation with typed command DSL, per-task sandboxing (default-deny egress), signed toolcaps, immutable logs. Results preview; methods in supplement.
