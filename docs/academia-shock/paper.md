# multilarity (Figure 1): How Many Small Autonomies Become Systemic Power
*Draft v0.3 · 20251114T220023Z*

We define multilarity (Figure 1) as compounding micro‑autonomy gains leading to effective independence without AGI [1,2]. Controls should align with NIST AI RMF and ISO/IEC 42001 [3,4], with supply‑chain provenance (SLSA, SBOMs) [5,6,7].
