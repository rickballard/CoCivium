# AI-Receipt: Bus board fix \/ urgent clinic ride (Eli)

**Context (1–2 lines).** Asthma flare; bus E.T.A. wrong; clinic closes in 18 min.

**Prompt to AI (short):**
> “I need the fastest safe way to get Eli to the clinic in <neighborhood>. Suggest options and draft one ask I can post now.”

**Steps taken (bullets):**
- Posted one ask in neighbors channel (auto-tag ‘urgent-ride’).
- Pinned one-tap phone link; accepted first vetted driver.
- Logged tap correcting bus board estimate.

**Artifacts:**  
- /receipts/2025-11-03_eli-ride.md (2m)  
- /receipts/2025-11-03_bus-correction.md (1m)

**One improvement:** Template the “urgent-ride” ask with time-to-close countdown.

**Trust notes:** PII trimmed; driver vetting via local ruleset v0.3.
