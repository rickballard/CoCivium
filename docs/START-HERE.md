Welcome! This repo houses CoCivium's docs + ops.

### Pick a path
- **New here?** Read the top of [`README.md`](../README.md) for the 1-minute “what/why”.
- **Want to contribute?** Start with [WORKFLOWS.md](WORKFLOWS.md) → idea → proposal → PR.
- **How we work & write?** See [STYLE.md](STYLE.md) and [ISSUEOPS.md](ISSUEOPS.md).
- **Terms you’ll see a lot**: [Lexicon](lexicon/WORKFLOW_TERMS.md) (short + human).

### Where *not* to click yet
We actively hide backlogs and experimental drafts so you don’t fall into stubs.
If you land on one, use the “Back to START HERE” link and open an issue with a link.
