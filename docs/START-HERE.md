# Start Here

**What this repo is:** a small, sharp seed we can build on.

**Do next (60s):**
1. Skim the [Backlog](backlog/TODO.md) — pick “Now” or add one.
2. Drop ideas as files in [/docs/ideas](ideas/README.md) (`scripts/new-idea.ps1 "Title"`).
3. When making changes, keep PRs tiny. Use the checklist in the PR template.

**Style:** prefer clarity over clever; small steps over big bangs.
