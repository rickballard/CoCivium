# CoCivium Vision

CoCivium is a practical path toward **consentful, polycentric governance** that scales from digital communities to neighborhoods and cities. We build rails for groups to decide, act, and learn — without recreating hierarchy.

**Highlights**
- Democracy beyond ballots: *consent first, voting as escalation*.
- Merit = stewardship (evidence of service), not power to command.
- Decide at the edge (subsidiarity), with portable records and auditable trails.
- Federation over centralization; protocols over personalities.

## 1) Democracy, updated
- Deliberation first (short summaries, tradeoffs, review date).
- Consent by default; formal voting when consent stalls (temp checks, ranked/supermajority where riskier).
- Every decision is recorded: problem → options → decision → obligations → review.

## 2) Why meritocracy (healthily)
- Steward roles are **time-boxed, recallable**, and reviewed.
- Separation of concerns (decide/implement/audit distinct).
- Open ladders: anyone can earn stewardship via visible work.

## 3) Decision mechanics
- Proposal spec: context → options → risks → obligations → “minimum viable decision”.
- Objections must cite safety/rights/coherence; record remediation.
- Timers + default next step prevent stalemate.

## 4) Decentralized cooperation
- Roles, not titles: Contributor • Steward • Resolver • Auditor.
- Shared backlogs, public caps on budgets, grants tied to delivered obligations.
- Interoperable, plain-file records (hashable when needed).

## 5) From Internet to real-world governance
- Friendly jurisdictions: co-ops/associations; publish charters & obligations.
- Unfriendly: *protocol, not organization*; diaspora chapters; conservative compliance.
- Portability across hosts (forums, repos, DAOs, municipalities).

## 6) Ethics (guardrails)
- Dignity-first; consent & revocability; least coercion that protects safety/rights.
- Open evidence; proportional remedies; protect dissent & skeptical safety.

## 7) Domains we engage (living map)
Finance & budgeting • Social safety • Health • Taxation • Wealth inequality • Education • Civic tech • Identity & privacy • Public records • Oversight.
(See /domains for briefs and exemplars.)

## 8) How to participate
1) Read **Consent** and **Resolution** primers.  
2) Join/start a project under /projects.  
3) Propose improvements via issues (content gap / refactor).  
4) Help draft domain briefs; run small, reviewable experiments.
