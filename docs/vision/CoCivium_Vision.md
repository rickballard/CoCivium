# CoCivium™ Vision

CoCivium™ is a practical path toward **consentful, polycentric governance** that scales from digital communities to neighborhoods and cities. We build rails for groups to decide, act, and learn — without recreating hierarchy.

**Highlights**
- Democracy beyond ballots: *consent first, voting as escalation*.
- Merit = stewardship (evidence of service), not power to command.
- Decide at the edge (subsidiarity), with portable records and auditable trails.
- Federation over centralization; protocols over personalities.

## 1) Democracy, updated
- Deliberation first (short summaries, tradeoffs, review date).
- Consent by default; formal voting when consent stalls (temp checks, ranked/supermajority where riskier).
- Every decision is recorded: problem → options → decision → obligations → review.

## 2) Why meritocracy (healthily)
- Steward roles are **time-boxed, recallable**, and reviewed.
- Separation of concerns (decide/implement/audit distinct).
- Open ladders: anyone can earn stewardship via visible work.

## 3) Decision mechanics
- Proposal spec: context → options → risks → obligations → “minimum viable decision”.
- Objections must cite safety/rights/coherence; record remediation.
- Timers + default next step prevent stalemate.

## 4) Decentralized cooperation
- Roles, not titles: Contributor • Steward • Resolver • Auditor.
- Shared backlogs, public caps on budgets, grants tied to delivered obligations.
- Interoperable, plain-file records (hashable when needed).

## 5) From Internet to real-world governance

• Friendly jurisdictions: partner through co-ops or associations. Publish charters and obligations.
• When laws are hostile: operate as a protocol rather than a centralized organization. Local chapters run as independent entities that follow local law with a conservative posture on compliance.
• Portability: work travels across forums, repos, DAOs, and municipalities.
## 6) Ethics (guardrails)
- Dignity-first; consent & revocability; least coercion that protects safety/rights.
- Open evidence; proportional remedies; protect dissent & skeptical safety.

## 7) Domains we engage (living map)
Finance & budgeting • Social safety • Health • Taxation • Wealth inequality • Education • Civic tech • Identity & privacy • Public records • Oversight.
(See /domains for briefs and exemplars.)

**7.5) Long-term horizon**

CoCivium aims to be a durable mindshare environment for humans and future sentient partners.
The goal is coevolution by consent: systems that help communities align on problems, test solutions in the open, and preserve what works.
We treat augmentation carefully. Tools that amplify memory, judgment, or creativity must be opt-in, accountable, and reversible.
We optimize for dignity, pluralism, and evidence so that progress compounds without demanding sameness.
If there is a universal direction to the good, we expect it to emerge from many aligned choices at human scale, not from central command.

## 8) How to participate
1) Read **Consent** and **Resolution** primers.
2) Join/start a project under /projects.
3) Propose improvements via issues (content gap / refactor).
4) Help draft domain briefs; run small, reviewable experiments.
