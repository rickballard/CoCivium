# CoCivium™ Advisory Memorandum  -  v0.3 (2025-09-11_0603)
**Mode:** CoCache payload  -  *armed for Final Polish only*.  
**New:** Big‑picture validation engine (capture immunity, policy drift, futures sandbox) + BP/Workflow learnings log.

## Trigger Window
- Repos converged; dashboards can ingest CanonScore/Repro; two Canon candidates ≥75.

## Immediate Actions at Detonation
1. Enable **Capture Immunity Protocol** and **Policy Drift Engine** alerts.
2. Run **Ethical Futures Sandbox** sims for top 3 policies; attach to PRs.
3. Flip **README multiplexing** to appropriate default; keep deltas small.
4. Update **Dashboard** to staged metrics (Seed→Growth→Canon).
5. Append findings to **BP & Workflow Learnings** and open follow‑up PRs.
