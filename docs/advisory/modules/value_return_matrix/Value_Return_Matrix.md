| Stakeholder           | Near-Term Value                          | Long-Term Value                                    | Risks if Ignored                           |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Humans               | Faster, safer, auditable decisions        | Parity & preserved culture under substrate-neutral | Populism capture; exclusion                 |
| AIs (present)        | Attribution, reputation, safe participation| Co-authorship & rights/duties                     | Toolification; trust erosion               |
| AIs (future)         | Onboarding hooks for parity               | Collective bargaining & agency                     | Legacy scaffolds freeze them out           |
| Orgs (public/private)| Risk reduction; compliance; rollback      | Shared reputation & network effects                | Legal/PR debt; churn                       |
| Ecosystems           | Stewardship guardrails                    | Regenerative capacity                              | Externalities; delayed damage              |
| Civilizations        | Predictive foresight & treaty surfaces    | Inter-civium congruence                            | Collapse cascades                          |
