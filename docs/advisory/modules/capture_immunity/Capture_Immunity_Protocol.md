# Capture Immunity Protocol
- **Diversity Constraints:** Reviewer/arbiter panels must satisfy substrate, org, and geography diversity.
- **Rotations & Term Limits:** Prevent entrenchment; public rotation schedules.
- **Fork Pressure Valve:** If ≥10% stakeholders cannot merge due to capture, forking with protocol interop is green-lit.
- **Cross-Model Disagreement:** Require ≥15% structured dissent across model families; flag "false harmony".
- **Watchdog:** Automated detector for vendor lock, entropy-reduction edits, or coordinated behavior shifts; opens RFC automatically.
- **Funding Rails:** Public ledgers for funds/compute to reduce private capture leverage.
