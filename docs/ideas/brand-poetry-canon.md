## Summary
Standardize poetic files: filename prefix, structure (beauty → duty → content → critique → call to CoEvolve → footer).

## Proposed Next Steps
- Create pattern doc and examples under docs/brand/poetry.  
- Add footer spec (version/congruence).

## Notes
- Convert to a Discussion for broad brainstorming, then track concrete tasks in linked Issues.
