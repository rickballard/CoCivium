# Ideas → how to propose change (not a stub)

**Use this when you have a spark** that isn’t a full proposal yet.

## What belongs here
- Problems worth exploring
- Small, testable improvements
- Questions that may lead to a proposal

## Three paths (pick one)
1. **Open an Idea Issue** → use the template: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/idea.yml`.
2. **Write a 1-pager** at `docs/ideas/<slug>.md` (use the starter below), then open a PR.
3. **Jump straight to Proposal** if you already know scope → see [WORKFLOWS](../WORKFLOWS.md).

## Triage & labels
Maintainers triage within ~3 working days → `needs-scope` / `accepted` / `parked` / `duplicate`.
Exit criteria: becomes a Proposal/PR or is parked with a note.

# Idea Cards

Each idea is a file here: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMZ-slug.md`.

Use `_template.md` as a starting point. Keep it short; one clear “next step.”
