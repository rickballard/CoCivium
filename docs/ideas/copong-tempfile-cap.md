## Summary
When a block is too big, CoPong should switch to a temp file in Downloads to avoid UI paste limits.

## Proposed Next Steps
- Add CoPongTempCache strategy to CoWorkbench.  
- Document in ONRAMP & README.

## Notes
- Convert to a Discussion for broad brainstorming, then track concrete tasks in linked Issues.
