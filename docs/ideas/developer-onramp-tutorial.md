## Summary
Orientation that hits hard: L4 agency, retooling to help democracy; optional poetic intro.

## Proposed Next Steps
- Draft structure (Lead-in → Why → How → Tactics → Guardrails → Call to CoEvolve).  
- Add “CoPing/CoPong” explainer.  
- Ship as docs/ONRAMP.md and link from README.

## Notes
- Convert to a Discussion for broad brainstorming, then track concrete tasks in linked Issues.
