## Summary
Avoid half-copied blocks; show clear “ready” state; support stacking multiple DO blocks into one safe execution.

## Proposed Next Steps
- Create “pastepack” zip/txt format with checksum + step delays.  
- Update CoWorkbench to import a local file when blocks exceed UI limits.  
- Add visual “ready” marker in rendered blocks.

## Notes
- Convert to a Discussion for broad brainstorming, then track concrete tasks in linked Issues.
