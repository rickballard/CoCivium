## Summary
Route high-level Human Gate prompts to the *appropriate* contributor (not broadcast to all). Mobile-friendly flow for quick approve/deny/route.

## Proposed Next Steps
- Define routing matrix (labels → CODEOWNERS/group).  
- Prototype “/gate” issue comment that pings the right people.  
- Add a minimal mobile approve/deny checklist to the bot reply.

## Notes
- Convert to a Discussion for broad brainstorming, then track concrete tasks in linked Issues.
