  "title": "CiviReform Kit — Post‑Capture Government Recovery Playbook",
  "summary": "Rapid, staged reboot for ministries after institutional capture: forensic inventory, integrity triage, staffed caretaker lanes, policy-as-code guardrails, and citizen audit loops using CoCivium primitives.",
  "rationale": "When agencies are hollowed or politicized, incoming stewards need a standard, non‑partisan recovery path that is fast, auditable, and resistant to re‑capture.",
  "impact": "Shortens time-to-function for critical services, rebuilds public trust through transparent checkpoints, and hardens org memory against future coercion.",
