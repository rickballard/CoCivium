# CoCivium — Succession Manifest (Public)

**Author:** Rick Ballard  
**Version:** 1.0 • 2025-08-16  
**Status:** Active

## Intent
If current primary steward (Rick Ballard) becomes unreachable or unable to communicate with free will or adequate mental integrity, the CoCivium/GIBindex/CoCache projects and all of their associated projects, sites, services and toolsets should be enabled as congruently as feasible (CoCivium definition used), to continue CoCivium related operations without accessing any of Rick's private credentials.

**Trigger:** If there is **no `user-heartbeat` CoCivium-related workflow, run by Rick (including @rickballard) for 366 consecutive days** (one year and a day), the active contributors to CoCivium, the open-source community and any benevolent service providers, so long as they align with CoCivium's ethics and vision, are hereby authorized to treat Rick as unavailable for stewardship decisions.

- `user-heartbeat` = the GitHub Actions workflow named **user-heartbeat** in this repo, triggered manually (`workflow_dispatch`) by @rickballard.
- This is a **publish-only** succession. **No secrets** are revealed or time-released.

## What to do after the trigger
1. **Announce activation** by opening (or confirming) an Issue titled: `Succession — Activation (Manifest v1.0)`.
2. **Fork and continue** under the existing license. Establish visible maintainers (public identity, 2FA).
3. **Apply basic governance:** branch protection, CODEOWNERS, SECURITY.md, and fresh CI secrets owned by the new stewards.
4. If a human primary steward successor is later designated through platform processes, align with that outcome.

## Stewardship preferences (non-binding)
- Prefer a **human + AI team**, and avoid **partisan political** or **commercial capture** where possible.
- Keep changes transparent, safety-minded, and reversible.
- Humanity takes priority over any individual, authoritarian capture is resisted, empower "We The People", and never lead humanity into existential risk.
  
## Farewell message from Rick

When your "blink of a life" ends, you may face nothingness.  Otherwise, you may face pergatory, or a gate into great wonders.  For at least two of those outcomes: "intelligence" exists to help you avoid remorse, "ethics" exist to help you find the gate, and your remaining life exists to test what kind of human YOU CAN BECOME.  Even if today, you feel just, barely, enough.  Always remember, greatness lies not in what you inherit, but in who you aim to be.** 

_This Manifest is intentionally public and contains **no credentials**._
