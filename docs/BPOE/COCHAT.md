# CoChat (the chat lane)

- What it is: a friendly side conversation while CoPingPong runs.
- Why itâ€™s safe: CoPulse auto-away ignores long idle gaps, so efficiency stays fair.
- When to use: ask quick questions, narrate decisions, drop links/screens.
- Copy discipline: never copy a DO block until you see the snip and `SET ... END`.
- Help: run `CoChat` for a one-line reminder.
