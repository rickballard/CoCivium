### ðŸ“Œ FOLDER VISIBILITY (GitHub Quirk)

GitHub may suppress folder visibility in the web UI unless:
- A `README.md` is present
- At least one non-ignored file is staged

**ALWAYS** include a `README.md` in UI-facing folders (e.g., `docs/**`, `outreach/**`, etc.)

CoCivium standard: every persistent folder has a `README.md`.
