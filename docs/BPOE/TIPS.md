# CoVibe Workflow Tips (CoPingPong)

- Copy only **after** you see the snip line and `SET … END`.
- If a DO block is long, **watch it finish** before copying; partial copies cause partial runs.
- Microtext mode: zoom out, scan for **red**; zoom in only to inspect.
- Single-line commands are shielded against double-paste bounces (CoShield).
- Use **CoSetStart/CoSetEnd** to wrap instruction sets; we snip **once** per set.
- DO blocks are lettered **A..Z**; steps show `[A.2@mmss]` so you always know where you are.


- After a session, run CoPulse to see sets today, median time, and average steps.

- If you pause (YouTube, coffee), run CoAwayStart 'break' and CoAwayEnd to keep **CoPulse active time** honest. Or set $env:COVIBE_IDLE_MAX_SECS (default 300s).

- **Distractions auto-counted:** CoPulse subtracts long idle gaps automatically. Tweak with $env:COVIBE_IDLE_MAX_SECS (default 300s).
- **Efficiency, not speed:** CoPulse reports workflow efficiency (active vs wall) as a rough satisfaction proxy. Parallel chat is fine—auto-away keeps it fair.
- **CoTip — Share what you see (screenshots):** Press **PrtScn** to copy screen to clipboard, **Win+PrtScn** to save to *Pictures\Screenshots*, or **Win+Shift+S** to snip an area. Then drag the latest image into ChatGPT so we can see exactly what you see.
