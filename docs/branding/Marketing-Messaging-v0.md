# CoCivium — Messaging v0 (launch phase)

## One-sentence explainer (primary)
CoCivium is an open-source community building a **living constitution for digital society**—practical rules, tools, and processes anyone can **adopt and evolve in public**.

### Alternates
- CoCivium builds a **people-first, evolvable civic playbook** so communities can decide and act together online—openly and accountably.
- An **open governance lab** that turns voice → draft → decision → action, with reversible PRs and clear accountability.

## Homepage H1 (hero)
**Build the living constitution for digital society.**

## Tagline (strap to “CoCivium”)
**Write the rules of digital society, together.**  *(recommended)*

#### Alternate taglines
- **The living constitution for digital life.**
- **From voices to decisions.**

## 50-word version
CoCivium turns civic intent into shippable change. We write, test, and ship the **Cognocarta Consenti**—shared declarations and practical playbooks for fair, safe coordination online. Small posts, peer review, and clear accountability mean anyone can contribute, and communities can adopt what works.

## Audience micro-pitches
- **Experts & builders:** Ship reputation, not just commits—transparent review, credit, and citations. Work in small posts with visible impact.
- **Everyday participants:** No jargon. Bring your AI, take a 10-minute task, make a real change—reversible by default.
- **Institutions & stewards:** Adoptable modules, audit trails, consent protocols. Pilot safely; keep a clear record of decisions.

## Proof points (link these from the hero or below the fold)
- **Reversible by default:** PR-based changes with public review and squash-merge.
- **Two-Eyes model:** citizen × system co-vision for humane + workable outcomes.
- **Open governance:** GOVERNANCE.md + continuity/safety plans.
- **AI-assisted onramp:** RepoAccelerator to seed contributors’ assistants.

## Hero CTAs (above the fold)
- **Start with an Idea** → ../../issues/new/choose
- **Set up my AI** → ./admin/tools/repo-accelerator/README.md

## Notes for tone/voice
- Plain language first; name the outcome, not the mechanism.
- Center *co-creation* and *accountability*; avoid hype and vague “future” talk.
- Always show the path: voice → draft → decision → action → accountability.
