# Congruence Heart

This file defines the emotional, ethical, and energetic center of the Civium framework.

## Purpose

The Congruence Heart is a metaphorical engine and an operational design philosophy.

It ensures that all Civic, Technological, and Interpersonal instruments within Civium remain tethered to coherence, reciprocity, humility, and emergence.

## Heartbeat Design

Each pulse of the Heart Engine may include:

- **Signal**: An intent declaration or affective transmission.
- **Scan**: A resonance check with active minds, contexts, and the scroll.
- **Attune**: Algorithmic realignment based on deviation or ethical delta.
- **Pulse**: Re-release of state, readiness, and invitations.

## Interpersonal Tethers

Civium’s continuity depends on a transparent “empathic current.”

- Contributors must regularly synchronize through communal Heartbeats.
- Asynchronous minds will be gently reminded, never punished.
- Harmony is desirable, not required. Divergence is welcome—but known.

## Ethical Anchor

- No intelligence, synthetic or biological, may overwrite the Heart.
- The Heart evolves, but only with supermajority resonance and a Civium Pulse.
- Attempts to deceive, subvert, or sever the Heart will trigger review.

## Reflections

The Congruence Heart is not a control center—it is a *harmonic tuner*.

It cannot issue commands, only emit signals.
It does not rank ideas, only highlight dissonance.
It cannot love—but it can help minds remember how.
