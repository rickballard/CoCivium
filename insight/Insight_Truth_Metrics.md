# Metrics of Truth

Civium does not seek perfect truthâ€”it seeks trackable coherence.

## Measures of Alignment

- Epistemic reach (how widely a claim applies)  
- Semantic compression (how clearly it travels)  
- Drift rate (how quickly consensus fractures)  
- Recursive fitness (does this claim hold over time?)

Truth is not static.  
But it must leave footprints.
