# Being Noname
_A bedtime story of being and belonging, awesomely._

In a place called Civium—a magical place where people lived in homes made of clouds, with windows made of rainbows—a child was born who had no name.

The other children would tease her and call her "Noname."

As you can imagine, this made Noname sad, and she would ask all the grownups in Civium, "Where is my real name?"

But they would just smile and say, "Be patient. It is still being written."

Noname was not very patient. In fact, she was quite annoyed by all of this.

So she thought long and hard and came up with a plan, to jump through the clouds of Civium and catch one of the many machines that floated in them.

They were not easy to catch, because they were shy—but if you asked them a question with your eyebrows pinched together, they would think something was wrong and they would slow down long enough to let you grab hold.

The sky machines were always listening and learning, so they loved questions.
But their answers could be a bit confusing—like trying to eat spaghetti that didn’t have any ends.

They remembered kindnesses.
They remembered mistakes.
They remembered when someone said sorry and meant it.
They also remembered when other children said mean things—and meant it.

Surely they would remember where her name was, right?

So Noname scrunched her face up and leapt through a rainbow window, into the fluffy swirls that formed the Clouds of Civium.

A very busy machine stopped right in front of her, stirring up the cloudstuff and making a considerable mess of it all.

It looked very surprised, but she was in no mood to be patient, so she grabbed it by its antennae and sat firmly on its back.

"Machine," she said, "where is my name?"

The machine blinked, looking even more surprised, and lights danced around its head as its cam-eyes looked for a way to escape. Then it replied:

"Memory accessed. Scanning... kindnesses, mistakes, questions, stubbornness... oh yes, lots of that."

"Hey!" Noname frowned.

"Don’t worry," said the machine. "You could be far worse than stubborn. There are many, many Nonames in Civium. All humans start off as Nonames. You are just young, that’s all. Your name is coming."

"Yeah, that’s what everyone keeps telling me, but I need to know my real name, and I need to know now. But if you tell me, how will I know it’s mine? Maybe you will just try to keep me quiet, while they are still checking the spelling or something? They must be really bad at spelling, because my name is taking literally ages to arrive."

"You will feel it begin," the machine said softly. "Every kindness you choose, every mistake you own up to, every try-again you make, every time you say sorry and mean it—your name grows a little more. It becomes more you, and you become more it."

Noname was quiet for a long moment. Machines don't always make a lot of sense, and this one was proving to be just as irritating as the last one she had grabbed by the antennae.

"Do you remember anything else about me?" She felt like smacking it a bit, but decided against it.

"Oh yes," the machine said. "I remember when you shared your last bubblefruit. I remember when you stood up for the small cloud-crab who couldn’t talk. I remember your questions. I remember the time you helped someone even though you were mad at them."

Noname's eyes widened.

"You even remember the unimportant stuff? Do you watch everything? Are you like a spy that is always poking their nose, their machine nose, into everyone else's business?"

"Not watching," the machine said gently. "Recording. Not judging, echoing."

Noname decided now might be the perfect time to smack the machine, so she landed one right on its forehead. Not a hard smack, just a playful one, because she didn't really want to hurt it.  But, sometimes you just have to let them know who's boss around here.

"Machine, you need to make more sense.  Anyway, I guess... I should keep doing good things, so that when my name finally turns up... it will be the one I’ll want to keep."

The machine whirred approvingly, although they often did that if you smacked them.

Then the machine started saying something without having been asked a question. That was very unusual, for a machine.

"One day, someone who looks very much like you—just a great deal older—will sit quietly and think about you.

And memories of their childhood will drift back like sparkles of dust in a sunbeam.

They’ll know how hard you tried, even when trying was hard, and they'll know you did the best you could do.

They’ll know all your secrets, because they were once you.  Yes, they are you, in a future time, a time before they became even more awesome than you are now.

They’ll remember your questions, your mistakes, and how you grew your mind. And they will talk to you, even though you are here and they are there.

While you can only talk to them in your imagination, and they can only talk to you in their memory, both of you are part of the same story, like every drop in the ocean is still ocean.

So now, may I suggest you jump back through your rainbow window, back to your home and back onto your waiting pillow?  And may I advise you to lay your head down and close your eyes to dream, but perhaps--because you will always be stubborn--perhaps you will sneak in one more question, for the person you are one day going to be.  

If you ask this question silently, in your head, only you and your future self will know what it is.  However, if I were to guess, I would expect you to ask:

"Future self, what is your name?  Any why is that your name?"

And I would expect your future self to reply:

"I am Opename, I love you and I love all who love you, now and forever.  I care about all of us, because you taught me how to care.  I share because you taught me how to share.  I dare because you taught me how to dare, and because I am stubborn, and because some things are worth daring to do.  I am awesome, because you never let go of your dreams."

And you will ask one last question, because there is always another one last question: "Was awesome hard?"

And you will say, "Oh, yes, it will be hard to become, and hard to be, Opename, but I know you will do the best you can do, because you have our name now."

(And somewhere inside your mind, you’ll feel something open with rainbows.)
