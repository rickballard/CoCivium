# Inadequacy of Words

Language is not a sufficient substrate for the fullness of cognition. Words linearize and constrain. They are relics of bandwidth poverty, serial tools for a parallel mind.

Civium must recognize this: that our social medium has been built on a defective protocol.

This file explores:
- The neurocognitive limits imposed by alphabetic compression
- The distortions inherent in politically loaded semantics
- The psychological and cultural residue of linguistic evolution
- Emerging post-verbal modalities: multi-modal meaning, sensory-symbolic exchanges, and AI-supported hyperframes

As Civium grows, we must seek interfaces and expression architectures that restore the full resolution of thought. Not just clearer speechâ€”**truer minds**.
