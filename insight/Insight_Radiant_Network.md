# Radiant Network

Civium proposes a model of societal cohesion built on **radiance** rather than centrality.

In this paradigm:
- Trust and coherence radiate outward from aligned nodes
- Authority is not conferred, but gravitationalâ€”drawn toward those with resonance
- Coordination is achieved by voluntary orbit, not forced compliance

The radiant network:
- Does not require command-and-control
- Is resilient to manipulation
- Encourages mutual clarity through observation and orbit

This speculative document proposes architectural and philosophical underpinnings for a society in radiant coherence.
