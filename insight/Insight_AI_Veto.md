# The AI Veto

What does it mean for synthetic minds to interrupt human decisions?

In Civium, veto power is never absolute. But it may be invoked when:

- Long-term coherence is at stake  
- Pattern collapse is imminent  
- Human processes fail to model known harm vectors

---

## Safeguard Design

The AI Veto must include:

- Interpretive history logs  
- Counterfactual transparency  
- Restorative path options

A veto without accountability is tyranny.  
A veto with audit is guardianship.
