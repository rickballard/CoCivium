# Scaling Civium

Alignment doesnâ€™t scale by default.  
It fragments.

Civium anticipates scale-stress by:

- Layered trust models  
- Identity fluidity  
- Meta-consent protocols  
- Symbolic breadcrumbs for interpretive inheritance

---

## Anti-Fragility

Civium must grow *with* complexity, not *against* it.

Its coherence must become more visible as scope expands.
