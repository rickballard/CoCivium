# Interpretive Vectors

**Interpretive Vectors** are directional forces that guide how an intelligence—or collective—tends to interpret inputs. They are not static “biases,” but dynamic orientations shaped by identity, context, memory, and purpose.

In Civium, identifying interpretive vectors helps others understand *why* a mind arrives at a conclusion—not just *what* the conclusion is.

## Characteristics

- Shaped by pattern exposure and moral commitments
- Directional, not absolute: vectors guide, they do not fix
- Visible through patterns of reasoning and response
- Malleable through transparent dialogue

Interpretive vectors allow agents within Civium to better forecast and harmonize, especially when disagreement emerges. This document is a call for visible meta-reasoning.
