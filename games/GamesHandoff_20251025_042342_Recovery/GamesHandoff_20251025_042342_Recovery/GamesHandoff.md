# 🎮 Games Session → CoPrime Handoff

## 📌 Session Summary (Games)

This session explored the potential for integrating civic-relevant game frameworks, models, or metaphors into the broader CoCivium ecosystem, with possible anchoring into `insights`, `academy`, or `public engagement` layers.

---

## ✅ Key Outcomes

- **Explored**: A wide range of directions including...
  - Game theory (social-choice framing)
  - Interactive diagrams and metaphor-driven learning
  - Token dynamics and scrip-based motivation engines
  - “Fix the World – The Game” conceptual asset
- **Generated**: Partial assets (some imagery, some diagrams, some markdowns)
- **Determined**: Insufficient design consensus for standalone repo yet
- **Staged**: This folder as a complete recovery artifact

## 🧠 BPOE Learnings / Wisdoms

- Handoffs must **always emit one canonical cloud path**.
- Images, diagrams, markdown fragments must be **packaged early and labeled**.
- Partial threads should **always be captured into context.md** or similar.
- Failed session momentum should **always be preserved if lessons were learned**.
