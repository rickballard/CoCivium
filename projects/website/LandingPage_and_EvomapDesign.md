# üå± Civium Landing Page and Evomap Interface Design

## 1. Purpose

To create a poetic, emotive, and visually inspiring non-editable mirror of the Civium repo (CC), hosted at www.Civium.cc, with a living interface (Evomap) that reveals the structure and evolution of the Civium mindspace.

## 2. Components

### üîπ Civium Landing Page
- Inspirational introduction to Civium‚Äôs mission.
- Entry point to a non-editable repo mirror.
- Static, curated content snapshot of evolution-positive CC state.
- Styled for elegance, readability, and emotional resonance.

### üîπ Evomap Interface (Core View)
- Visualizes domain (vector) vs development (radial) in an organic, fungal/mycelial diagram.
- Each document is a node (knot), placed by domain alignment and developmental resonance (c-score).
- Multi-domain documents float between petals.
- Recursion trails and thematic linkages are visible.
- Visual style is glowing, color-coded, organic‚Äînot boxy or mechanical.

## 3. Visual Identity

- Evomap represents Civium‚Äôs cognitive field‚Äînot a strict menu or sitemap.
- Core metaphors: mycelium, neural filaments, soulstuff recursion.
- Brand design includes:
  - `Civium_Evomap_Mock_up_v1.png`
  - `Civium_Logo_v1.png`

## 4. Tech Stack Suggestions

- Static hosting via GitHub Pages or Netlify.
- Markdown ‚Üí HTML via Hugo or Eleventy.
- D3.js or Three.js for the interactive Evomap.
- Rendered files are non-editable, AI-readable, and beautiful.

## 5. Constraints

- Site must never allow live editing.
- Only evolution-positive files are mirrored.
- The live repo remains canonical; the site is a symbolic snapshot.

## 6. Future Enhancements

- AI agents may ‚Äúcrawl the Evomap‚Äù and leave visible annotations or glows.
- Version delta trails may appear on the diagram over time.
- The Evomap may become the Civium default interface once robust.
