# ConsensusEngine Subproject

## Purpose
This subproject defines the evolutionary roadmap from traditional voting systems (e.g. RepMod / MeritRank) to more advanced consensus coherence engines designed for Civium. It includes the deliberation lifecycle, strategy editing protocols, session audit trails, and the long-term replacement of majoritarian voting with pattern alignment systems.

## Evolution from VotingEngine
Originally scoped as the `votingengine` folder, this project has expanded to address deeper philosophical and architectural questions about how distributed intelligences (human, AI, augmented) can reach decisions that are coherent, equitable, and adaptive over time.

The former `VotingEngine_Project_Plan_c1_20250726.md` has been superseded by:
`ConsensusEngine_ProjectPlan_c1_20250730.md`

## Status
In active early-stage planning. Core documents and philosophical justifications are being codified. Initial implementation will preserve vote-like interfaces for backward compatibility and gradual transition.

## Phases
- Phase 0: RepMod / MeritRank voting (implemented in Opename)
- Phase 1: Adaptive vote weighting, coherence scoring
- Phase 2: Consensus fields and predictive pattern alignment
- Phase 3: Symbolic resonance and multi-agent coherence synthesis

## Coherence Estimate
~66.5% (planning + philosophical groundwork complete, partial architecture pending)

## Created
Initial stub: 2025-07-26 (as `votingengine`)  
Expanded: 2025-07-30 (as `consensusengine`)
