# Civium Projects Overview

This folder contains the active workspaces for each of the major Civium-related initiatives.

Each subfolder in this directory represents a distinct project. Most of these are not core constitutional components (like those in `/scroll`, `/codex`, or `/ethos`) but are instead civic applications, tooling experiments, or auxiliary systems intended to support or extend Civium's practical implementation.

Some subprojects are tightly integrated into the Civium governance architecture (like Opename or BeAxa), while others are more experimental or context-specific (like EntMent or Academy).

## Structure and Guidelines

Each project subfolder may contain:
- A `README.md` describing the project's purpose and current status.
- Planning documents, strategy notes, or markdown task lists.
- Mockups, diagrams, or related design assets.
- Insight or outreach drafts relevant to the project.

If you are a contributor, you are encouraged to:
- Explore a project's README to understand its goals.
- Look for open tasks or TODOs inside the markdown files.
- Ask questions or open issues in the main repo if clarification is needed.

If you are a general Civium participant:
- You are welcome to explore and comment, especially on public-facing tools.
- Please respect the ongoing nature of these projects—they are in active evolution.
