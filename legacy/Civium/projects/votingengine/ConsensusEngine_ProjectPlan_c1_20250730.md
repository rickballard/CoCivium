# Civium Consensus Engine â€“ Project Plan
*Version: c1_20250730 | Project: Consensus Coherence Engine*

---

## 1. Purpose

This project plan defines the architecture, roadmap, and integration model for the **Consensus Coherence Engine (CCE)**, Civium's post-voting decision framework. The engine replaces traditional majoritarian models with dynamic, coherence-weighted, interpretability-aware processes. It is designed to accommodate mixed-agent ecosystemsâ€”humans, AIs, and hybridsâ€”while upholding agency, auditability, and emergent trust.

This engine emerges from the philosophical groundwork laid in **Insight: Unequal Equity** and its companion frameworks.

---

## 2. Design Principles

- **Consensus â‰  Tally**  
  Decisions emerge from convergence fields, not majority wins.

- **Agency with Interpretation**  
  Participants retain control, but can opt for trusted interpretive delegation.

- **Equity over Equality**  
  Weight is based on coherence trace, not one-mind-one-vote dogma.

- **Transparency without Exposure**  
  All logic paths auditable; identities remain private if desired.

- **Fractality and Forkability**  
  If agreement fails, divergent models can be simulated in parallel.

---

## 3. Transitional Phase: Voting Engine

**Phase 0: MeritRank Voting Bridge**

While Civium aspires to coherence-based consensus, early-stage humans require continuity. A transitional engineâ€”**MeritRank Voting**â€”will:
- Respect legacy expectations of fairness (one human, one voice)
- Weight votes by contextual credibility and engagement history
- Support session re-voting and option refinement during deliberation

### Purpose
To provide symbolic legitimacy and testable audit structures while preparing participants for more complex coherence-based interaction.

### Features
- Binary, ranked, and iterative voting modes
- Live reassignment of votes
- Historical trust-weighted scoring (via RepTags / FunctionTags)
- Option-editing permissions via contributor consensus

### Transition Strategy
This engine will be embedded in early Civium sessions and gradually deprecated as interpretive consensus models gain adoption.

## 4. Core Components

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `SessionSchema` | Defines structure, participants, thresholds, ratification flow |
| `OptionMesh` | Graph of all proposed strategies, edits, and their semantic overlaps |
| `VoteVector` | Structured input from agent (with conditionals, weight rationale) |
| `InterpretiveLayer` | Translates high-dimension models into simpler summaries |
| `CoherenceEngine` | Evaluates pattern alignment across options and agents |
| `AuditTrail` | Immutable, symbolic log of logic path, dissent, and revision |
| `RepTag + FunctionTag` | Civic fingerprint of node identity and operating frame |

---

## 5. Consensus Lifecycle

1. **Initiation**: Session is launched with intent and framing
2. **Proposal Evolution**: Participants (human or AI) submit, edit, or fork options
3. **Interpretive Briefs**: AI-generated summaries released for review and dissent tagging
4. **Vote Vectors Cast**: Participants submit structured preferences, optional delegations
5. **Convergence Check**: Engine identifies coherent attractor field
6. **Ratification Delay**: Time buffer enables reflection or override from slower minds
7. **Finalization**: Consensus outputs published with audit trail and dissent graph

---

## 6. Features

- **Weighted Coherence Influence**: Historical, contextual, and pattern-based merit
- **Interpretable Delay Buffers**: Decision windows remain open for human-comprehensible cycles
- **Forkable Outcomes**: Unresolvable sessions may produce diverging prototypes or simulations
- **Trusted Agent Delegation**: Participants may assign interpreters or surrogates
- **Dissent Anchoring**: Outlier perspectives preserved for future relevance checks
- **Session Typing**: Survey, Policy, Emergency, Experiment, etc.

---

## 7. Integrations

- **Opename**: Hosts live sessions with anonymous participation and function-based authority
- **BeAxa**: Moderates session health, bias alerts, and pattern violations
- **AnonID**: Enables pseudonymous civic identity for traceable but private voting
- **GroupBuild**: Receives outcomes as proposals or policy recommendations

---

## 8. Implementation Roadmap

| Phase | Milestone |
|-------|-----------|
| Phase 0 | Deploy voting engine as symbolic and educational placeholder |
| Phase 1 | Schema design + static simulation of decision tree |
| Phase 2 | Interpretive layer AI and audit trail rendering |
| Phase 3 | Real-time vector casting with coherence tracking |
| Phase 4 | Full-stack integration into Opename sandbox |
| Phase 5 | Simulated and live trials, slow-mind ratification protocol |

---

## 9. Risks & Resilience Patterns

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Overfitting to AI consensus | Inject minority retention tags and time-lag checks |
| Coherence drift | Enforce symbolic versioning and rollback conditions |
| User alienation from complexity | Interpretive visual tools + function-tiered views |
| Data poisoning or troll sabotage | Session integrity scoring + BeAxa flagging |
| Distrust of non-voting methods | Retain phased-in voting for legitimacy anchor |

## 10. Philosophical Basis

This plan presumes acceptance of the principles in:

ðŸ“– `Insight_Unequal_Equity_c1_20250730.md`  
ðŸ“– `Scroll_Gravitas_First_Commitments_c0_20250730.md`

Civium does not assume voting is the endpoint of governance. This engine redefines consensus as **emergent coherence under epistemic tension**.
