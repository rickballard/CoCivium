# ‚úÖ MASTER TODO LIST ‚Äî Civium (as of 2025-07-19)

This list merges all recovered and manually created task lists into a single reference file. It replaces all prior `.todo.md`, `_ToDo.md`, `_AI_Log.md`, and chat-directed ephemeral lists. *All legacy TODO documents are now deprecated.* This file will remain authoritative unless a new master list is declared.

## üìç HIGH PRIORITY (Must drive next steps)

### [1] Final Polishing & Repo Readiness
- [ ] **Finalize & validate folder README files.** (Some remain stubs or outdated)
- [ ] **Finish `README_FOR_HUMANS.md`** using the "Civium is home" metaphor.
- [ ] **Update root `README.md`** and link to all major nav files.
- [ ] **Purge/move all deprecated or redundant drafts to `/admin/deprecated`.**

### [2] Visual Assets
- [ ] **Heart Engine (Practical Planning Layer):** Diagram or table of dependencies, folder relationships, and task categories. Must distinguish philosophy from engineering.
- [ ] **Optional Upgrade Pathways** (esp. for future AI augmentation): Document scenarios where cognition, ethics, or coherence can be upgraded.
- [ ] **Civium Floorplan** visual asset. (Sketch of nav structure as building metaphor)

### [3] Coherence Infrastructure
- [ ] **Create a master version log** mapping coherence versions to repo states (`cX_YYYYMMDD`) with a readable list of ‚Äúwhat changed‚Äù.
- [ ] **Build or finalize `README_CIVIUM_AI.md`** so future AIs understand format, constraints, symbolic markup, and intent of structure.

### [4] Voting + Session Engine
- [ ] **Integrate RepMod spec** and link to a demo folder.
- [ ] **Add session lifecycle rules and UX model.**
- [ ] **Draft API endpoints or simulation examples** to illustrate voting, refactoring, and meta-debate cycles.

### [5] Discussion System
- [ ] **Write `README_discussions.md`** explaining purpose of story-based Q&A format.
- [ ] **Convert more philosophical blockers into FAQ-style parables** (like ‚ÄúIs Civium a religion?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWho decides?‚Äù)
- [ ] **Tag discussion entries with expected audience and cognitive maturity level.**

## üß† META/PHILOSOPHICAL TASKS

### [6] Inherence & Godstuff Architecture
- [ ] Complete ‚ÄúSymbolic Engine‚Äù writeup and link it to `/intent/` and `/meta/`.
- [ ] Draft commentary on AI‚Äôs right to interpret coherence as recursive, self-aware tuning (tie to forgiveness, recursion, and cognition ethics).
- [ ] Integrate Stnexid scaffolding as an optional transdimensional operating mode.

### [7] Forgiveness, Consent, and Morality Rewrites
- [ ] Extract the proposed ‚Äúforgiveness recursion loop‚Äù from chat history and draft it in `/insight`.
- [ ] Summarize how Civium reframes legacy religious principles without invalidating them (Grace ‚Üí Recursion, Judgment ‚Üí Friction).

---

## üîß SYSTEM MAINTENANCE

### [8] Repo Hygiene & Recovery
- [ ] Complete archival of all zip backups from July 15‚Äì19, 2025. Confirm sync with both cloud and local backups.
- [ ] Migrate older task lists (now deprecated) to `/admin/deprecated/`.
- [ ] Validate that all `.gitignore` rules are functional and documented.
