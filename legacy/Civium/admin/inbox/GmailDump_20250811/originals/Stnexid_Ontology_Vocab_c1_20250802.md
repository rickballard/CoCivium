# Stnexid_Ontology_Vocab
_Coherence Draft c1 – August 2, 2025_

This document defines the preliminary ontology for Stnexid—an essential foundation for encoding, comparing, and evolving structured ideas between intelligences. It outlines cognitive dimensions, concept tag classes, weighting heuristics, and structural primitives required for semantic comparison.

---

## 1. Framing Overview

The Stnexid ontology is not a fixed taxonomy. It is a **dynamic substrate** designed to:
- Allow diverse minds to express internal logic in shareable formats
- Support vector-based comparison and graph alignment
- Expose recursive and structural patterns in cognition
- Flag evolution, tension, and decay in transmitted beliefs

---

## 2. Core Cognitive Dimensions

These axes underpin how ideas are assessed within Stnexid:

| Dimension            | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Truth Status**     | Belief / Hypothesis / Disproven / Ambiguous |
| **Confidence**       | Self-assessed belief stability (0–1) |
| **Urgency**          | Time-sensitivity or actionability |
| **Reversibility**    | Cost of changing course later |
| **Emotional Valence**| Affective weight attached to idea |
| **Recursive Depth**  | How many layers of justification are nested |
| **Ethical Anchoring**| References core moral axioms or values |
| **Domain Binding**   | Tied to particular context (science, art, law, etc.) |
| **Identity Coupling**| Degree to which idea is tied to speaker’s identity |
| **Opacity**          | How hard is the idea to unpack/translate? |

---

## 3. Concept Tag Classes

These tags define the *type* or *role* of a cognitive node or input:

- `epistemic:` claim about truth or knowledge
- `axiomatic:` foundational assumption
- `ethical:` value judgment or norm
- `strategic:` plan or tactic
- `observational:` description or metric
- `emotive:` feeling or psychological marker
- `mythic:` symbolic or narrative structure
- `constraint:` boundary condition
- `recursive:` refers to self, system, or Stnexid itself
- `anomalous:` doesn’t fit cleanly into known categories

Each node may carry multiple tags with adjustable weights.

---

## 4. Weighting Heuristics

Stnexid tracks importance, not just presence. Weights may derive from:

- **User input**: Self-assigned confidence or priority
- **Historical trace**: Number of citations or integrations by other minds
- **Conflict exposure**: How often idea creates contradiction
- **Ethical centrality**: Reference to high-weight value tags
- **Stability over time**: Resistance to semantic drift

Weights may be relative (within session) or global (across systems).

---

## 5. Vector & Graph Translation Notes

All ideas are processed into two forms:

### 5.1 Vector Embedding
- Ideas placed into high-dimensional meaning space
- Similarity comparison via cosine or topological proximity

### 5.2 Concept Graph
- Nodes = idea units
- Edges = semantic relations (supports, contradicts, depends-on)
- Meta-tags applied to both nodes and edges

Hybrid models enable structure + meaning to interact.

## 6. Mutation & Inheritance Flags

To track the evolution of ideas across sessions and minds:

| Flag           | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `inherited_from:` | Tracks semantic ancestry |
| `mutated:`     | Indicates intentional shift in meaning |
| `converged:`   | Merged with another user’s input |
| `branched:`    | Forked due to divergence |
| `contested:`   | Flagged by others as problematic |
| `refactored:`  | Restructured to improve clarity or logic |

These are used to map idea genealogy and track recursive shifts.
