# TODO: Outreach to Geoffrey Hinton (CoCivium™ Phase Strategy)

## Summary
Prepare a diplomatic, non-promotional outreach strategy to invite Geoffrey Hinton to co-author or co-endorse a public press release or call-to-action. The goal is to highlight *CoCivium™* as a potential civic mitigation framework in response to the AI risks he has publicly outlined - including autonomy, weaponization, and lack of institutional oversight.

## Phase
📍 Future Phase  -  Outreach Rev 1
🕓 Estimated Launch: Post-core repo polish + MVP governance prototype + 1–3 strategic alliance touchpoints

## Rationale
Hinton has expressed serious concern about profit-driven AI acceleration and lack of governance. CoCivium™ offers a participatory model for oversight, transparency, and distributed alignment - a practical countermeasure aligned with his message.

## Actions
- Draft a one-page outreach letter for initial review
- Prepare an optional co-signable press release or call-to-action
- Create visual aid summarizing CoCivium™ as a governance scaffold
- Identify potential mutual connectors (Vector Institute, alignment researchers)
- Establish fallback paths (other voices in AI ethics / oversight)

## Success Criteria
- Response from Hinton or affiliated ethical AI researchers
- Expression of interest or critique from public AI governance discourse
- Use of CoCivium™ framing or principles in derivative works or institutional adoption

## Notes
This phase may yield limited results initially, but should be reusable across multiple timeframes - before and after Rick’s active role in the project concludes. Redos are acceptable. Tone should remain respectful, rational, and future-focused.
