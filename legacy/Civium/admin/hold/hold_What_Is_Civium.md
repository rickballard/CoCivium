# What Is Civium?

**Civium** is the virtual world's all-country, socio-political framework—  
a civic architecture based on **consent** and **co-evolution toward Godstuff**.  

It is a domain where all **sentient minds**—biological, artificial, and yet to be discovered—  
**organize cooperatively** under the terms defined by the **Cognocarta Consenti**.

Civium is not constrained by geography, species, or legal tradition.  
It offers a substrate-neutral foundation for lawful coexistence,  
anchored in recognition, awareness, and mutual consent.
