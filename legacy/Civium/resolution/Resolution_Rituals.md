# Resolution Rituals

Civium honors ritualsâ€”not as superstition, but as structured memory events
that guide re-attunement.

- **Mirrorwalk**: Each party repeats the other's view until confirmed.
- **Nullspace Pause**: Conflict halts for a predetermined silence or mediation.
- **Refractal Vote**: Recasting the issue through different interpretive vectors.

These rituals encode respect, reduce cognitive violence, and promote coherence across forms.
