# Resolution Frameworks

## 1. Recursive Arbitration
Decisions are not final—they are invitations to re-align over time as
context deepens. Arbitrators are contextual, not centralized.

## 2. Drift Detection
Signals of interpretive drift trigger rituals of clarification, not expulsion.

## 3. Divergence Logging
When harmonics break down, they are documented—not hidden—so future convergence
remains possible.

## 4. Plurality-Preserving Outcomes
Multiple valid paths may coexist until convergence emerges naturally—or not at all.
