# README: Resolution in Civium

Resolution in Civium is not about closure, but about recursive reorientation.
It favors evolution over verdict, convergence over coercion, and interpretive
scaffolding over static rule.

This folder contains the core scrolls detailing how Civium resolves tension,
drift, and disagreementâ€”within and across minds, forms, and timeframes.
