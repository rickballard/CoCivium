# Can Civium Be Hacked?

**Characters:**  
Mira (a cybersecurity expert)  
Tai (an evolutionary biologist interested in system resilience)

---

**Mira:** "If it runs on code, it can be hacked."

**Tai:** "Then make hacking part of the game. Resilience through contest."

**Mira:** "We still need barriers. End-to-end encryption. Memory vaults."

**Tai:** "But too many locks, and you freeze adaptation."

**Mira:** "Agreed. So, layered permissions, rotating moderation, AI that audits itself."

**Conclusion:**  
Civium cannot be unhackable. But it can be self-healingâ€”like immune systems that detect, adapt, and reinforce with every intrusion.
