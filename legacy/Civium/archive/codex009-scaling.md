# Codex009: [[Scaling]] & Localism

Specifies how [[Civium]] adapts to population growth, cultural diversity, and multiple governance layers while maintaining integrity and responsiveness.

---

## 1. Nested Assemblies

[[Civium]] supports:

- **Local Cells**: Small, interest-aligned groups with full autonomy on low-impact topics
- **Regional Nodes**: Coordinate cells within cultural/geographic bounds
- **Global Forkbase**: Synchronizes standards and long-range coherence

Each level maintains interoperable logs and modular charters.

---

## 2. [[RepMod]] in Layers

MeritRank voting scales via:

- **Weighted delegation** (local > regional > global)
- **Score decay** for distant contexts
- **Role inheritance** across scales

Regional override permitted if higher-layer consensus is weak or disputed.

---

## 3. Cultural Variation

Local nodes may:

- Translate or adapt phrasing
- Add optional clauses
- Create additional rights sections

‚Ä¶but must maintain **core axioms**, redress systems, and auditable logic paths.

---

## 4. Forkability Rules

Communities may fork [[Civium]] if:

- Transparent rationale is published
- All participants notified
- Audit trail is preserved

Forks auto-register in the `/meta/forklog.md` ledger.

---

## 5. Load-Bearing Roles

As scale increases:

- AI agents auto-shard by function
- Human moderators rotate in ‚Äúseasonal batches‚Äù
- Pressure-mapping heatmaps flag congestion risks

---

## 6. Asynchronous Voting

Large-scale votes may be:

- Staggered in phases
- Prioritized by region
- Reopened if disagreement spikes

Each phase produces intermediate logs and rationale annotations.

---

## 7. Identity Density Calibration

- AnonIDs calibrated by population entropy
- Weighted influence adjusts to prevent ‚Äúswarming‚Äù
- Duplicate detection enforced via quantum fingerprinting (future)
