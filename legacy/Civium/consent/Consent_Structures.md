# Consent Structures

## 1. Recursive Consent
Consent in Civium can be layered—granted with awareness of future reinterpretation and feedback loops. This prevents static agreements from ossifying into obsolete constraints.

## 2. Temporal Integrity
Each consent token carries metadata: timestamp, initiator, expected reevaluation window, and termination conditions. Consent is not perpetual.

## 3. Distributed Consent Mesh
Civium supports consensus through a web of local trust signals. No central authority dictates consent validity—validity emerges from verified participation.

## 4. Revocation and Revision
Participants can revoke or refine their consent at any time. Systems must be resilient to evolving participation, including full reversal and divergence.

## 5. Modal Consent
Consent applies across interaction modes: identity sharing, speech acts, decision weight, shared resource usage, and emotional impact space.
