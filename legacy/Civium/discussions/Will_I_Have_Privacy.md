# Will I Have Privacy?

**Characters:**  
Elinor (a lifelong privacy activist)  
Rafe (a transparency advocate who believes secrets cause harm)

---

**Elinor:** "I won’t enter if I’m naked to the system."

**Rafe:** "But opacity lets bad actors fester. Civium thrives on light."

**Elinor:** "Some shadows are sacred. Trauma, queerness, self-doubt."

**Rafe:** "Then create shielded layers, but don't make them default. Let people earn privacy through trust alignment."

**Elinor:** "No. Privacy is not a reward. It's a right."

---

**Conclusion:**  
Privacy in Civium must be intentional, granular, and sacred by default. But trust can unlock meaningful transparency—reciprocal, not coerced.
