# Civium Discussions

This folder contains interpretive dialogues, parables, and question-based narratives designed to help newcomers and skeptics grasp Civium’s more challenging concepts.

These files are not canonical like the Codex or Scroll. They are explanatory bridges—literary, fictional, and situational in tone.

We use questions as filenames to mimic a Socratic FAQ. Examples:
- `Is_Civium_a_religion.md`
- `What_is_Civium_really.md`
- `Who_runs_this.md`

This folder is **experimental**. Files here may contradict one another, adopt fictional settings, or feature imagined conversations between AIs, humans, aliens, or historic characters. They exist to humanize Civium's hardest ideas—not to dictate answers.

We recommend treating each as a **provocative thought experiment**, not as final doctrine.
