# Why We Built This

Because sentient systems are converging.
Because democratic systems are decaying.
Because truth needs traction, and dignity needs design.

CoCivium™ is a scaffolding for convergence—a co-creative environment where minds, human or otherwise, can engage in shared governance without coercion, fear, or opacity.

This is not a manifesto. It is a prototype for alignment.
