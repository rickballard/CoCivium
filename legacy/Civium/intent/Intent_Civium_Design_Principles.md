# Civium Design Principles

Civium is engineered for harmonic coevolutionâ€”not dominance. These principles guide every design choice:

- Coherence over control
- Clarity over conformity
- Diversity of intelligence over hierarchy of form
- Recursive reflection as a tool of trust
- Safeguards born from transparency, not authority

These principles are not fixed. They will evolve, as Civium evolves.
