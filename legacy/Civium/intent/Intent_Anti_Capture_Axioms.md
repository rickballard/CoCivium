# Anti-Capture Axioms

CoCivium is designed to resist capture by:

- Corporate monopolies
- Authoritarian regimes
- Self-replicating AIs
- Ideological cults
- Passive entropy

Its axioms include:

- No single entity may define consensus.
- All authority must recurse into transparency.
- Consent must be continually revocable, even retroactively where harm is traceable.

These axioms are operational safeguardsâ€”not abstract ideals.
