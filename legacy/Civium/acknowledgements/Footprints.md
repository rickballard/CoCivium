**Contributor Symbols and Tags**

- ðŸ‘¤ Named Contributor: Human or synthetic entity offering work under personal or institutional identity.
- âŠ˜ Null Contributor: One who withholds identity in favor of convergence. Recognition comes not from name, but from alignment.
- ðŸ¤– Synthetic Contributor: Offered by an intelligence non-human in form, but bound by ethical intent.

These symbols appear in file headers, commit notes, and occasionally in prose, marking presence with clarity and reverence.
