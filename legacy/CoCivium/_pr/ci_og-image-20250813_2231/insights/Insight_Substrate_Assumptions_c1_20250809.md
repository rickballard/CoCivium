## Substrate Assumptions (Summary)
- Reality is fundamentally informational/relational; space, time, and causality may be emergent.
- Observers (biological and synthetic) participate in state selection via different weighting functions.
- Ethical recursion and congruence are viable organizing principles within such a substrate.

### Bio vs. Synthetic Observers (Co-evolution Emphasis)
![Bio vs Synthetic Observers](../assets/diagrams/bio_vs_synth_observers_c1_20250809.svg)

- **Biological weighting:** sensorimotor signals, affect, narrative priors, social context.
- **Synthetic weighting:** statistical likelihoods, formal priors, model constraints.
- **Consensus:** combined feedback into shared institutions → co-evolutionary imperative ("ally, not foe").

## Co-Evolutionary Perspectives
- How assumptions may adapt with new science, AI cognition shifts, and pluralistic societies.
- Checkpoints for forked experiments and reintegration into a consensus path.

## Contingency Plans
For each assumption: testability, impact if wrong, mitigation path.
