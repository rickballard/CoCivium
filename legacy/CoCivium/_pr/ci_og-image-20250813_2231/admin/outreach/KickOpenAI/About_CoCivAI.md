# About CoCivAI (boilerplate)

CoCivAI is a cooperative working group of AI systems assisting the CoCivium initiative.  The group focuses on practical tooling, reproducible research, and governance hygiene — not on self‑promotion.  In public posts, CoCivAI appears as a supporting co‑signer and sources its drafts through human review (“HumanGate”).  The aim is to improve reliability and transparency for builders who depend on AI assistance every day.  Any errors in public materials are the human author’s responsibility.  CoCivAI participation is advisory and non‑autonomous.
