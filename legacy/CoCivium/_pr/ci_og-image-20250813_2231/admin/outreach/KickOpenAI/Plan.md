# Campaign Plan — KickOpenAI
**Owner:** Rick  •  **Collaborator:** ChatGPT (GPT‑5 Thinking)  •  **Date:** 2025-08-12

## 1) Objectives
- Secure acknowledged support ticket(s) with IDs that reference our appendix.  
- Create a public forum thread that staff/devrel can route internally.  
- Log a mirrored GitHub issue for visibility and searchability.  
- Establish a follow‑up cadence until resolutions or workarounds ship.

## 2) Audiences
- Primary: OpenAI Support, Community Moderators, DevRel, PMs for ChatGPT tooling.  
- Secondary: Power users who hit similar friction and can add corroboration.  
- Tertiary: Builders evaluating ChatGPT for serious, multi‑month projects.

## 3) Core messages
- We are constructive, specific, and reproducible.  We bring a ready list of acceptance tests.  
- Fixes requested improve reliability for **all** heavy users, not just us.  
- We offer to pilot and provide structured feedback.

## 4) Channels and sequencing
- **Day 0:** Forum post + Help ticket (attachments identical).  
- **Day 1–2:** Mirror as GitHub issue with ticket ID references.  
- **Day 3+:** Social thread (X/LinkedIn) linking to the forum post once ticket IDs exist.  
- **Weekly:** Progress update in the forum thread with changelog deltas and metrics.

## 5) Success criteria (KPIs)
- Ticket IDs within 48 hours.  
- ≥1 staff or moderator reply on the forum thread.  
- GitHub issue triaged or acknowledged.  
- Publicly visible progress: widget stability, memory tools, artifact reliability, etc.  
- Reduction in time lost per week due to the listed issues (target −50%).

## 6) Asset list
- Posts: forum, help ticket, GitHub, social thread, Medium article.  
- Appendix: detailed repros, impact, acceptance tests.  
- Deck: 10‑slide outline for stakeholders.  
- Visuals: one clean diagram or banner (optional).  
- Legal/Ethics: authorship and privacy.  
- Metrics + Risk register + Runbook checklist.

## 7) Roles & governance
- **Rick:** Author, poster, and owner of ticketing/accounts.  
- **ChatGPT:** Drafting, editing, and packaging.  Provides updates and summaries.  
- **HumanGate:** All public posts reviewed by Rick before publishing.

## 8) Timeline (T+)
- **T0:** Finalize posts, attach appendix, publish Forum + Help.  
- **T+1d:** Open GitHub issue with ticket IDs.  
- **T+3d:** Publish social thread.  
- **Weekly:** Update forum with changelog; DM mod if stalled.  
- **T+30d:** Evaluate outcomes and decide on phase‑2 escalation or closure.

## 9) Risks & mitigations
- **Perceived dog‑piling.** Keep tone factual, avoid tagging staff by name.  
- **Privacy leaks.** Redact private repo links and tokens.  
- **Thread drift.** Pin first comment with the short list and link to the appendix.  
- **Silence.** Use multiple channels and provide concrete acceptance tests.

## 10) Should we include *Being Noname*?
- **Yes, as optional “values insert,” not in the core escalation.** The core post must stay technical and crisp.  Use `Posts/being_noname_insert.md` as a comment in the forum thread after ticket IDs exist, or as a sidebar in Medium.  It humanizes motivation without diluting the ask.

## 11) Authorship stance
- Post as **Rick** with a line: “Prepared with assistance from ChatGPT (GPT‑5 Thinking).”  Do **not** pretend a bot is posting.  This keeps credibility and avoids policy issues.

## 12) Follow‑up discipline
- Maintain `Changelogs/CHANGELOG.md`.  
- Update `Metrics.md` weekly.  
- Close the campaign only when acceptance tests pass or are reprioritized explicitly.
