# KickOpenAI — Outreach Pack
**Purpose.** A focused, respectful escalation to OpenAI about workflow bugs and product gaps blocking the CoCivium project.  The goal is constructive: increase signal, reduce friction, and co‑create fixes that benefit many users.

**Outcome we want.** A human‑acknowledged ticket chain, a staff‑visible forum thread, and one devrel‑visible GitHub issue — plus a follow‑up cadence until fixes ship or workarounds land.  All artifacts here are ready to copy‑paste.

**Principles.**
- Accurate, reproducible, concise.  No venting.  No pile‑ons.  
- Authored by Rick, crediting assistance from ChatGPT (GPT‑5 Thinking).  
- No impersonation.  No leaking private data.  Respect rate limits and community rules.

**How to use this folder (TL;DR).**
1) Post `Posts/forum_post.md` to the OpenAI Community Forum with `Appendix/CoCivium_OpenAI_Bugs_Appendix_2025-08-12.md` attached.  
2) Open a Help Center ticket using `Posts/help_ticket_summary.md` and attach the same appendix.  
3) Open a GitHub issue in `openai/openai-cookbook` using `Posts/github_issue.md`.  
4) Publish `Posts/x_thread.txt` and optionally `Posts/medium_article.md` after ticket ID is known.  
5) Track outcomes in `Changelogs/CHANGELOG.md` and metrics in `Metrics.md`.  

**Optional additions for reach.**
- Share a 10‑slide deck outline (`Deck/10slides_outline.md`).  
- Add a short values‑forward insert derived from *Being Noname* to humanize the ask (`Posts/being_noname_insert.md`).
