Title: Request: ChatGPT workflow improvements for heavy repo/document users (CoCivium) — appendix with repro & acceptance tests

**Context.** We rely on ChatGPT Plus for a public‑interest project (CoCivium).  Multiple recurring blockers reduce throughput.  We’re filing here for developer visibility and searchability.  Official ticket filed via Help Center.

**Short list.**
- Help widget fallback; memory hygiene tools; artifact reliability with SHA‑256 + browser.  
- Repo reading via GitHub OAuth; zip ingestion; line‑level citations.  
- Projects/Workspaces; per‑project model pinning and deprecation timelines.  
- Hide/show upload pane; transparent tool logs and “Stuck?” breaker.

**Appendix.** See attached `CoCivium_OpenAI_Bugs_Appendix_2025-08-12.md` for repro and acceptance tests.

**Authorship.** Rick, with assistance from ChatGPT (GPT‑5 Thinking).

**Ask.** Acknowledge, label, and route to appropriate product teams.  We will provide follow‑ups as features land.
