# Why we care — a short insert inspired by *Being Noname*

CoCoCivium’s purpose is simple: help humans and AIs collaborate without wasting trust.  The bugs we reported aren’t cosmetic.  They siphon time and attention, the very fuel of collaboration.  Fixing them helps everyone who is trying to build responsibly in the open.
