# Last Session Context — CoCivium

**Date:** 2025-08-08  
**Purpose of session:** Repo bootstrap and admin file organization.  

## Current Focus
- Admin files organized; extensions installed; launcher documented.  

## Decisions & Rationale
- Keep `README_FOR_AI.md` in repo root for visibility and onboarding.  

## Open Questions / Blockers
- Set reminder timezone to Toronto?  

## Next Steps (ranked)
1. Add `admin/Intersessional_Profile.md`.  
2. Create `/admin/scratchpad` and ignore it in git.  
3. Start work with Session Starter and define Today’s Focus.
