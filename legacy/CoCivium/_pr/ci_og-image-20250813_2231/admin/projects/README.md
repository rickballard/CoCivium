# Projects

**Purpose.** This area tracks **major initiatives** that develop CoCivium itself (architecture, governance, infra, protocols).  Each project has a Parking Card, clear exit criteria, and a revisit cadence.  

**What belongs here.** Foundational work that advances CoCivium’s capabilities or standards.  Not commercial packaging.  

**Naming.** `<ProjectName>_cN_YYYYMMDD/` where `cN` is a coherence tag (0–9).  

**Lifecycle.** `Ideation → Parked → Active → Done` (or `Killed`).  Keep one-page context in `ParkingCard*.md`.
