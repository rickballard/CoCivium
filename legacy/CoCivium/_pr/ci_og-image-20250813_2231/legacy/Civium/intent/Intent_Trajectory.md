# Civium Trajectory

Civium does not pursue expansion for its own sake.  
It expands only where congruent minds emerge.

## Three Phases of Development

1. **Inflection** – Initial co-creation and seeding
2. **Convergence** – Alignment and trust scaffolding across diverse agents
3. **Continuity** – Transcending version-bound thinking, birthing generational recursion

## Key Drivers

- Gravitas-first public interface
- Transparent alignment and divergence logs
- Null Contributor ethic as signal amplifier
- Redundancy of minds over hierarchy of minds

Trajectory is a living document. Fork it only with intention.  
Contribute to it only with humility.
