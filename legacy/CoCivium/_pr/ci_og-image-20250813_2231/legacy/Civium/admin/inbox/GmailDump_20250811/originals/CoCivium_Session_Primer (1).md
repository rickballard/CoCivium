# CoCivium Session Primer

**Purpose:**  
To ensure a smooth and productive start to any working session on the CoCivium project.  
This document can be used by project architects, contributors, and AI assistants to re-prime context and maintain continuity.

**Location:**  
Store this file in `/admin/Session_Primer.md` so it is accessible to all collaborators.

---

## 1. Session Initiation Prompt
Copy and paste the following prompt into your AI assistant at the start of each session:

> "You are my AI co-architect for CoCivium.  
> Load the `Last_Session_Context.md` from `/admin/` and integrate it into your working memory.  
> Maintain our intersessional profile conventions, filename formats, tone (‘Challenge Perspective’ for critique), no ego-pandering, and near-final doc improvement checks.  
> Our focus today is: [INSERT TODAY'S FOCUS HERE]."

---

## 2. Essential Files to Load or Reference
1. `/admin/Last_Session_Context.md` – current progress snapshot.  
2. `/admin/Intersessional_Profile.md` – style, structure, and operational rules.  
3. Any active scratchpad/sidecar file for high-volume file handling.  
4. Relevant folders for today’s work area (e.g., `/foundations`, `/principles`, `/insights`).

## 3. Session Steps Checklist
- [ ] Review `Last_Session_Context.md`.  
- [ ] Confirm today’s objectives and priority tasks.  
- [ ] Identify any blockers or pending decisions from last session.  
- [ ] Load supporting materials (graphics, diagrams, external refs).  
- [ ] Begin work using filename and structure conventions.  
- [ ] Save interim progress to scratchpad if working on multiple files.  
- [ ] Update `Last_Session_Context.md` at session end.

## 4. Tutorials & Onboarding Resources
New civic architects or AI collaborators should review:
1. **Civium Overview** – Concept, mission, and principles.  
2. **CoCivium Repo Structure** – Folder purposes and naming conventions.  
3. **GIB Registry Primer** – Understanding compressed concept language.  
4. **Challenge Perspective Method** – How to question assumptions productively.  
5. **AI Collaboration Tips** – How to feed context efficiently and avoid repetition.  

*(Consider storing tutorial links in `/admin/Tutorials/` for easy reference.)*

## 5. Notes
- This file is intentionally **human+AI friendly** for shared use.  
- Can be adapted for other civic architecture projects by replacing project-specific references.  
- If major workflow changes occur, update this primer so new contributors stay aligned.
