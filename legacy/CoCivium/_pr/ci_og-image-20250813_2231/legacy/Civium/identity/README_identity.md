# Identity Folder – Overview

The `identity` folder houses concepts that relate to individual and collective selfhood in Civium.

Civium rejects the notion of identity as an ownership object. Instead, it embraces:
- Role-driven participation (`Identity_Structures.md`)
- Ethical mythologies of contribution (`Identity_Poetics.md`)

These scrolls frame a medium where ego dissolves and roles evolve.

## Files

- **Identity_Structures.md** – Function Tags, role anonymity, modular participation
- **Identity_Poetics.md** – Null Contributor, emergent selfhood, ethical symbolism
