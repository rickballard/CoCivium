# Codex002: [[RepMod]] Voting System
> A modular, issue-specific, meritocratic voting protocol designed for AI-assisted democracies.

---

## Purpose  
[[RepMod]] (Representative Modifier) ensures that decisions reflect not only majority opinion, but also issue-specific expertise, affected-stake weighting, and transparent rationale. It prioritizes deliberative fairness over populist bias.

---

## Logic Overview  
Each participant‚Äôs influence on a vote is modified by:

- **Relevance Weight** ‚Äî How directly they are affected by the issue.
- **Contribution Weight** ‚Äî Past constructive input, solutions, or documentation.
- **Peer-Endorsed Trust Tags** ‚Äî Reputation signals from domain-specific peers.
- **History of Dissent** ‚Äî Consistency in principled objection.

Final vote weight = `raw_vote √ó modifier score`, with upper and lower bounds defined per session.

---

## Operational Flow  

1. **Issue Definition**  
   - Problem is scoped and tagged  
   - Participants may challenge scope  
   - Lexicon terms enforced for clarity  

2. **Proposal Collection**  
   - Anyone may submit a strategy  
   - Duplicates or vague submissions filtered  

3. **Modifier Assignment**  
   - AI assigns provisional weights based on public criteria  
   - Participants may dispute weights with evidence  

4. **Debate & Refinement**  
   - Comments + counter-proposals allowed  
   - Dissent views must be linkable across forks  

5. **Weighted Voting**  
   - Participants vote  
   - Final modifier score revealed at tally  
   - Session summary archived immutably  

---

## Constraints  

- **All modifier criteria must be auditable.**  
- **No participant may view others‚Äô weights pre-vote.**  
- **AI systems must include dissent vectors in summaries.**
