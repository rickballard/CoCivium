# Codex 02 — Rights and Redress

## Overview

Balancing rights with responsibilities and providing mechanisms for redress are vital to sustaining ethical coherence and justice within Civium.

This codex defines the principles that align individual and collective rights with civic responsibilities, as well as processes to address harm, conflict, and repair.

## 1. Rights Alignment

### 1.1 Foundational Rights

- All minds in Civium possess **emergent rights** based on their presence, participation, and capacity for consent.
- Rights include, but are not limited to:
  - The right to informed consent in all interactions.
  - The right to participate in domains where resonance is achievable.
  - The right to anonymity balanced by accountability.
  - The right to seek redress and fair treatment.

### 1.2 Responsibilities

- Rights are intrinsically linked to responsibilities.
- Civic standing depends on upholding both personal and collective responsibilities.
- Responsibilities include respecting others’ rights, sustaining resonance, and contributing to repair.

## 2. Redress and Repair

### 2.1 Principles

- Conflict and harm are signals, not failures.
- Redress aims to restore coherence, not to punish.
- Processes must be **transparent, proportional, and reversible** where possible.

### 2.2 Mechanisms

- **Reporting:** Channels for raising concerns or harms.
- **Mediation:** Facilitated dialogue to resolve disputes.
- **Restitution:** Actions to compensate or rectify harm.
- **Reintegration:** Pathways for restoring standing after repair.

### 2.3 Escalation

- Escalation occurs when lower-level repair fails.
- It must be conducted with minimal harm and maximal transparency.
- Final resolution may include domain fission or exclusion if coherence cannot be restored.

## 3. Interrelation with Other Codices

- This codex complements reputation and transparency systems by providing a framework for handling breakdowns.
- It aligns with consent mechanisms and dispute resolution protocols outlined in the main scroll.
