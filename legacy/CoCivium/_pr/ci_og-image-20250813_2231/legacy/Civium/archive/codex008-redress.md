# Codex008: [[Redress]] & Reversibility

Specifies how [[Civium]] handles mistakes, unfairness, or harm caused by system actions or consensus outcomes. Includes error audits, reversal protocols, and user-triggered appeals.

---

## 1. Auditability

Every action traceable via:

- Immutable event logs
- Model-influence audits
- Stakeholder interaction snapshots

Triggered automatically if harm is alleged or confidence threshold is breached.

---

## 2. Harm Detection

Harm may be:

- Algorithmic (e.g., biased moderation)
- Structural (e.g., representation gap)
- Emergent (e.g., unintended collective effects)

Flagged by:

- Affected users
- External watchdogs
- Self-monitoring agents

---

## 3. Appeal Rights

Users may:

- Initiate an appeal via interface or agent
- Request temporary reversal (‚Äúfreeze‚Äù status)
- Nominate independent reviewers or AI panel
- Add evidence and contextual data

Appeals may be public or pseudonymous.
