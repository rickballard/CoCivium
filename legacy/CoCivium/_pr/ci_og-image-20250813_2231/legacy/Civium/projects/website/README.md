# ðŸ§­ Civium Website Project

This subfolder contains all design, strategy, and content work for the Civium website. The site is intended to be the public-facing entry point for new visitors, prospective contributors, civic technologists, and aligned minds interested in exploring or building within the Civium framework.

## [1] Purpose

The Civium website should communicate the mission, structure, and invitation of Civium clearly and compellingly. It is not just a landing pageâ€”it is a portal to a new paradigm of collective governance, AI alignment, and trans-human collaboration.

## [2] Goals

- ðŸŒ€ Host evocative diagrams (e.g. the Evomap)
- ðŸ§  Introduce core concepts (e.g. Cognocarta, RepMod voting, AnonID, Opename, etc.)
- ðŸš€ Provide clear onboarding for contributors (technical, artistic, civic, etc.)
- ðŸªª Present ethical, anonymous, secure methods for identity and authorship
- ðŸªž Reflect the visual and ethical tone of Civium (clarity, recursion, invitation, non-coercion)

## [3] Tasks (Planned / In Progress)

- [x] Design landing page mockups âœ…
- [x] Draft evomap and site architecture âœ…
- [ ] Finalize sitemap
- [ ] Write copy for major pages (Home, Vision, Get Involved, Academy, Repo Portal, etc.)
- [ ] Implement front-end (likely with React + Tailwind)
- [ ] Connect to GitHub repo and sandbox demo
- [ ] Publish to domain (e.g. civium.cc or civium.world)

## [4] Structure

This folder may contain:
- Diagrams (`*.png`, `*.svg`, etc.)
- Strategy plans (`*_plan.txt`)
- Markdown drafts (`*_vX.md`)
- Source or exportable site components (if applicable)

## [5] Participation Model

This project is currently being led and maintained by a single contributor (Rick). As Civium grows, others may choose to join specific subprojects like the website, in which case clearly defined roles (e.g., UI Designer, Developer, Content Curator) may emerge organically.

All future contributors are expected to:
- Maintain congruence with Civiumâ€™s core principles.
- Prioritize clarity, simplicity, and ethical transparency.
- Use pseudonyms or remain anonymous if preferred.
- Avoid centralization of decision-making wherever possible.

_This section will be revised when additional contributors begin participating._
