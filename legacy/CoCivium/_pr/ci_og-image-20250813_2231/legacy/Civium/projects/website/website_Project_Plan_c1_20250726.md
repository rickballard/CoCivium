## 1. Purpose

The CoCivium™ website serves as the primary public-facing information hub for visitors unfamiliar with CoCivium™ or any of its subprojects. It must clearly communicate CoCoCivium’s ethos, the structure of its initiatives, and pathways for public involvement—without overwhelming new users.

## 2. Core Functional Goals

- 🌐 Clear explanation of CoCoCivium’s purpose, structure, and principles
- 🧭 Interactive Evomap for navigating the CoCivium™ landscape
- 🔗 Gateway links to each subproject
- 🗳️ Strategy Voting walkthrough
- 📚 Glossary, Codex, and Insight archives
- 📥 Contributor onboarding

## 4. Design Guidelines

- No surveillance or engagement-bait design tropes
- Every page must educate, not just inform

## 6. Integration Notes
