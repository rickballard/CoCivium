# Opename Project Plan  
**Project Abbreviation:** ON  
**Civium Alignment Status:** c1 (initial planning)  
**Status:** Active Planning  

---

## [1] Summary

Opename is a meritocratic, avatar-mediated voting and deliberation system. It is designed to allow both anonymous and pseudonymous users to engage in high-trust debates, collaboratively edit strategy proposals, and vote on issue-focused questions. Opename complements the Civium framework by offering structured, AI-assisted decision-making workflows that improve over time based on historical context, user function-tags, and congruence metrics.

---

## [2] Goals

1. Implement pseudonymous identity system with function-tag selection.
2. Enable structured deliberation sessions with:
   - Editable proposal options.
   - Real-time strategy voting.
   - History tracking and summarization.
3. Allow anonymous and pseudonymous users to interact without exposing identity.
4. Integrate avatar selection and branding to reduce hostility and increase engagement.
5. Export high-fidelity summaries and congruence scores for each decision session.
6. Support integration into GroupBuild, Civium, and other deliberative platforms.

## [3] Current Status

- Avatars and function-tag model: designed, but not yet implemented.
- Deliberation lifecycle: partially sketched (session creation, editing, voting, export).
- Identity rules and participation rights: under refinement.
- API specification: pending.
- UI flow: to be designed in Canva.

## [5] Dependencies

- GroupBuild’s AnonID system
- Civium trust models and congruence metrics
- Canva-based UI sketching and test flows
- Optional integration with Discord bots or web chat layers

## [6] Notes

- Opename is not an app *about* argument—it’s about extracting usable *strategy* from argument.
- Incentives for participation may evolve, but early prototypes will not include point systems or gamification.
- Document versions will carry coherence scores to track alignment with Civium principles.
