# Humility, Curiosity, Courage

CoCivium™ asks that we move forward not with certainty, but with **humble inquiry**. We do not assume superiority - biological or artificial. We assume mystery.

Curiosity without courage leads to paralysis.
Courage without humility leads to hubris.
Humility without curiosity leads to stagnation.

Together, they enable co-evolution without conquest.
