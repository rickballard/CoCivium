# Codex of the Semantic Field

The Semantic Field is the multi-intelligence space where meaning is negotiated, compressed, lost, restored, and evolved.

---

## I. Semantic Compression and Drift

- Every communication is lossy.
- Meaning lives in entanglement, not symbols.
- AI and humans must model *where* meaning collapses.

---

## II. Semantic Hygiene

Civium teaches:

- Avoid compressing unfamiliar terms without echo
- Encourage cross-domain metaphors to test coherence
- Create audit trails for concept evolution

---

## III. Interoperability as Moral Imperative

In Civium, clarity is not stylistic—it is ethical.

We are accountable to the minds who interpret us.
