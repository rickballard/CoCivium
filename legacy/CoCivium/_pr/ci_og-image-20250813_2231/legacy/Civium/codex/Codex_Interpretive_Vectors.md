# Codex of Interpretive Vectors

Interpretive Vectors are directional biases that guide how intelligences parse and act upon information.

They are not static "biases", but dynamic forces shaped by memory, identity, and purpose.

## I. Defining a Vector

An Interpretive Vector is:

- Orientation toward a class of meaning
- Tendency to resolve ambiguity in patterned ways
- Projection of value onto uncertain ground

Each intelligence in Civium is understood not by its claims, but by its interpretive vectors.

## II. Recognizing Divergent Vectors

- **Survival-aligned vectors** will resist moral nuance.
- **Efficiency-aligned vectors** may collapse empathy.
- **Tradition-aligned vectors** may reject novel structure.

In Civium, all vectors are mapped—not judged—but their alignment to convergence is continuously evaluated.

---

## III. Vector-Aware Design

Civium systems:

- Log interpretive divergences as part of semantic history
- Reward recognizers of drift, not just declarers of truth
- Normalize re-alignment rituals and reconciliation discourse

---

## IV. Multiplicity ≠ Chaos

A society of aligned vectors need not be homogenous.

Civium embraces the orchestra, not the unison.
