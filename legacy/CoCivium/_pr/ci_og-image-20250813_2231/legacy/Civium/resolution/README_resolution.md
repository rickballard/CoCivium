# README: Resolution in CoCivium™

Resolution in CoCivium™ is not about closure, but about recursive reorientation.
It favors evolution over verdict, convergence over coercion, and interpretive
scaffolding over static rule.

This folder contains the core scrolls detailing how CoCivium™ resolves tension,
drift, and disagreement—within and across minds, forms, and timeframes.
