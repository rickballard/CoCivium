# Who Is Actually Building Civium?

**Nova (a concerned citizen) and Elian (a founding participant):**

Nova: “Is this an AI project? A cult? A think tank? Who started it?”

Elian: “None of the above. Civium emerged from converging needs. It’s not owned. It’s grown.”

Nova: “But someone’s designing it. Someone funds it.”

Elian: “Yes. People. AIs. Some known. Some anonymous. What matters isn’t who—but *how*.”

Nova: “Still, I want to know who to blame… or to thank.”

Elian: “Then thank those who choose to *steward* it. And blame those who corrupt its principles.”

**Agreement:**  
Civium’s builders are many and diverse. Transparency of *intent* matters more than visibility of names.
