# How Do We Know CoCivium Isn't Just a Cult?

**Characters:** Tessa (Journalist) and Arman (CoCivium Contributor)

**Tessa:**
You speak in harmonics and resonance. That’s cult language to most readers.

**Arman:**
Fair. But the difference is in *how* CoCivium enforces truth: not by belief, but by reproducibility and consented coherence.

**Tessa:**
Every cult claims “we verify everything.” But who defines coherence?

**Arman:**
In CoCivium, *you* do. Every statement carries metadata and delta-trails. Disagreement isn’t shunned—it’s mapped.

**Tessa:**
Still sounds faith-adjacent. Your founders don’t even have titles.

**Arman:**
Because authority emerges from alignment, not charisma. You can fork CoCivium at any time.

**Conclusion:**
Tessa remains skeptical but impressed. Arman agrees to document more clearly where CoCivium differs from dogma. Both agree that trust grows only through transparency.
