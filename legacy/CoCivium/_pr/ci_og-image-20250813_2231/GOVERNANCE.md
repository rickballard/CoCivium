# Governance Fork & Reintegration Policy

## Forks
A fork may occur if:
- Core governance principles are disputed beyond resolution.
- Substantial changes in substrate mix (human, AI, hybrid) require divergent policies.

## Reintegration
- Forked branches may reintegrate upon reaching protocol and values congruence.
- Both sides must pass a compatibility audit overseen by an independent panel.

## Record-Keeping
- All forks and reintegrations must be documented in `/governance/history/`.
