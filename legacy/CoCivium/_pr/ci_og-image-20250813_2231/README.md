# CoCivium

Democracy protocols and civic-tech tools for borderless governance.

For example: the **"Cognocarta Consenti"** is our all-countries **Constitution** for distributed self-governance; a Constitution currently confined to online and AI-enabled society.  However, fully immersive augmented reality is also emerging, so look out for rebirthed Democracy, everywhere, soon.

## The Opportunity

"We The People" continually re-invent ourselves and our societies.
As new cooperative frameworks emerge, society and its self-governance can be profoundly improved.
Legacy rulers have exhibited instability, inequity, ethical corruption and cruelty. 
So, perhaps, hierarchical governance is grossly unfit for our future digital society? 
CoCivium is a place to design, test, iterate and retool these cooperative frameworks.
Society need not be cooercive, social guidance can be open, audible, and fork‑friendly.
Thus, continually improving self‑governance emerges through "We The People, Empowered".

## What is CoCivium?

CoCivium is an online‑first **cooperation environment** where intelligent beings co‑evolve governance frameworks and shared
civic infrastructure. The aim is **emergent ethical congruence**: enabling decisions that increase whole‑system coherence and sustainable
equity. Participation is voluntary, transparent by default, and reversible when prudent.

## Core Principles

**0)** **Prime Directive — Congruence (recursive ethics).** Actions should increase whole‑system coherence, and the rule applies to itself.  

**1)** **Consent over coercion.** Opt‑in, informed, granular, revocable.  

**2)** **Accountability with trails.** Clear owners, appeals, restitution, public rationale.  

**3)** **Transparency by default; privacy by right.** Open process/code; user‑owned keys; portability; erasure.  

**4)** **Evidence over authority.** Claims need sources, tests, and adversarial review.  

**5)** **Least power, staged risk.** Minimal permissions; sandboxes; kill‑switches; reversible‑first.  

**6)** **Fairness and proportionality.** Rights floors; merit‑weighted influence; proportional sanctions.  

**7)** **Pluralism and interoperability.** Many worldviews; shared protocols; easy fork‑and‑rejoin.  

**8)** **Resilience via redundancy.** No single point of failure—technical, social, or legal.  

**9)** **Commons stewardship.** Open licenses; contributor covenant; anti‑enclosure.  

**10)** **Incentive alignment.** Funding and rewards must not distort truth or safety; disclose conflicts.  

**11)** **Antitrust of power (human or AI).** Caps on governance share; rotation; independence tests.  

**12)** **Continuous improvement.** Versioned experiments; metrics, rollbacks, upgrade paths.  

**13)** **Non‑violence and dignified discourse.** Mediation over flame wars; restorative outcomes.  

**14)** **Sustainability and long‑termism.** Price externalities; favor multi‑generational impact.  

**15)** **Inclusivity and accessibility (all minds).** Real access for human and synthetic minds; strong on‑ramps.
