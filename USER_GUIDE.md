## 1) Start Here (overview)
**The idea in one minute.** Democracies are running twenty-first-century societies with nineteenth-century operating systems.  CoCivium is an open, consent-first civic stack that helps communities propose, debate, and adopt better decisions ‚Äî with transparent trails, reversible changes, and lightweight reputation.  It is free, open source, and built to be co-evolved by humans and AIs.

**What CoCivium is.** A living library of patterns, docs, and small tools (CoModules) for consentful governance.  A place to practice rapid, safe civic iteration.  A neutral, non-commercial commons.

**What CoCivium is not.** A political party.  A surveillance system.  A token-pump.  A substitute for local law.  We augment institutions; we do not bypass them.

**What exists today.** A canonical root README, a CC draft, early CoModules (CoAgent Kit, Repo Accelerator, CoCache, GIBindex), and initial workflows (HumanGate, squash-merge, decision trails).  Demos are simple but real.  More is coming.

**How to participate.** Pick the tile that matches you.  Citizens read and respond.  Builders ship tiny improvements.  Stewards keep the rails safe.  Educators run kid-friendly challenges.  Partners align funding and pilots.  Youth players explore ethics through play.

**Safety & governance.** We follow the Cognocarta Consenti (consent not coercion), a Code of Conduct, and HumanGate (human review before merges).  All changes are traceable to issues/PRs/commits.

**Where to ask for help.** Open a GitHub Discussion or Issue.  Join the read-only Matrix CoCivBus to observe progress.  Use templates.  Keep questions small.

## 3) Core Concepts

### 3.1 Cognocarta Consenti (CC)
**At-a-glance.** A living scroll that encodes ‚Äúconsent not coercion‚Äù into practice.  Change proposals are transparent and reversible.

**Why it matters.** Governance must be changeable without chaos.  CC is the rulebook for edits to the rulebook.

**Key elements.**  Consent gradients, objection handling, ratification cycles, reversibility windows, and public decision trails.

### 3.2 Congruence Layers
**At-a-glance.** Two layers: operational congruence (does this work safely now?) and deep congruence (does this align with mission and ethics?).

**Use.** We prefer small operational wins that conserve deep congruence.  When in doubt, pause and check both layers.

### 3.3 Decision Trails
**At-a-glance.** Every material change is traceable from issues/PRs to commits and releases.  No private side channels for decisions.

**Benefit.** Audits, reversibility, and onboarding new contributors quickly.

### 3.4 RepTags & GIBindex
**At-a-glance.** RepTags are lightweight acknowledgments of helpful contributions.  GIBindex is our glossary/registry with provenance.

**Benefit.** Shared language reduces confusion.  Reputation remains descriptive, not financialized.

### 3.5 HumanGate
**At-a-glance.** Humans review merges until our guardrails are proven safe.  Exceptions require justification and quick post-hoc review.

**Benefit.** Safety first while enabling AI-accelerated throughput.

## 4) Tools & Modules (CoModules)
**CoAgent Kit.** Assisted contributor flows.  Prompts, scripts, and templates for shipping small improvements consistently.

**Repo Accelerator Kit.** Scaffolds for new modules with CI, docs, and release wiring pre-baked.

**CoCache.** Cross-repo sidecar memory and ops notes.  Keeps session context and decisions portable.

**GIBindex.** Registries and terms with provenance.  Powers the glossary.

**CLI helpers (PS7).** `Watch-Checks` for CI, `gpw` for push-and-watch, `CoStage` for WIP snapshots, and `CoPingPong` for long instruction handshakes.

**Troubleshooting.** If CI fails, read the error first.  Re-run locally.  Ask for a second set of eyes with a link to your PR.

---

## 5) Initiatives & Experiments
**Dual README.** Human and AI voices in parallel to improve clarity and inclusivity.

**In-doc A/B Switcher.** Offer contrasting straw-man proposals to teach by comparison and record preferences.

**Fix the World: The Game (FTW).** Mobile-first ethics play that feeds anonymized insights into real proposals where appropriate.

**CivicFit Engine (CoFit).** Models market demand and fit for governance tools.  Pairs with Grant Use Policy for values-aligned funding.

**Market-Demand Modeling.** Profiles likely users and policies to prioritize high-impact work.

**Parallel Workflow Strategy.** Run low-risk tasks beside deeper discussions to keep momentum.

**For each initiative, we track.** Problem, hypothesis, MVP, how to help, status, and metrics.

---

## 6) Governance & Safety
**Code of Conduct.** Be respectful.  No harassment.  Resolve conflicts with restorative steps.  Escalate via listed maintainers.

**Privacy & Data Handling.** Minimal data, transparent uses, opt-outs.  No hidden analytics.

**Licensing & Attribution.** Institutional authorship by default.  Optional explicit credit on request.  Keep traceability for reversibility.

**Signing Keys & Releases.** Who signs what, with rotation and revocation plan.  Release tags are machine-lowercase; the site shows human-readable aliases.

---

## 7) Contributing Workflow
**Happy path.** Issues ‚Üí Branch ‚Üí PR ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Squash ‚Üí Delete branch.  Keep changes small.

**Labels.** `domain`, `product`, `ops`, `ci`, `wiki`, `content`, `refactor`, `funding`.

**Style.** Two spaces after periods.  US spelling, except Dogs n Homes uses UK spelling.  Standard headers/footers.  Congruence labels allowed.

**Commit & PR templates.** Conventional commits and short bodies with ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù

**Reverts & rollbacks.** Keep ONEBLOCK-style notes for quick undo paths.

---

## 8) Metrics & Roadmap
**KPI dashboard.** Adoptions of charter, decisions recorded, objections resolved, reviewed decisions per month.  Later: contributor retention and time-to-first-PR.

**Release scheme.** Machine-lowercase tags (`cc-v1`, `cocivop-v0.1`), with human aliases on the site.  Squash merges keep history tidy.

**Roadmap.**
- **0‚Äì3 months.** Guide v1 in repo.  FTW tutorial.  A/B switcher prototype.  Basic metrics badge.
