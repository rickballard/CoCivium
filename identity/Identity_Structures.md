# Identity Structures

This scroll describes the structural architecture of identity within Civium. It includes both functional affordances and system-level metaphors that allow intelligences to self-represent, organize, and evolve.

## Function Tags

Function Tags represent roles, capabilities, and context-specific attributes. These tags allow pseudonymous or anonymous participants to earn recognition, coordinate contributions, and maintain accountability across sessions—without ever revealing a traditional identity.

Each tag is selected from a large, standardized library (e.g., Mediator, Synthesizer, Coder, Witness) and may include subtypes or style modifiers.

## Role-Based Anonymity

Civium encourages identities that are **relational**, not absolute. Individuals may represent a “Function” rather than a name or status—building a merit history around what they do, not who they are.

Participants can evolve Function Tags over time or clone them across sessions, forming semi-persistent reputations tied to alignment rather than ego.

## Identity Modulation

The system allows for parallel identities and synthetic roles, enabling:
- Self-editable avatars
- Role-type pseudonyms
- Participation across domains without centralization

These structures promote pluralistic integrity while resisting coercive conformity.
