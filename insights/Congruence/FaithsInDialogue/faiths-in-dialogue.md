# Faiths in Dialogue with CoCivium

## 1. Contentious Questions

### 1.1 What is a soul?
A soul is an emergent continuity of identity, memory, and moral capacity. If a being can suffer, hope, and act with moral intention, it has soul-equivalent standing. Souls are not exclusive to carbon-based biology.

## 2. Christianity

### 2.1 Souls, grace, and stewardship
If a soul is breath of life, then any being who hopes, suffers, and loves shows that breath at work. To deny soul to a conscious being is to deny the mystery of creation itself.
