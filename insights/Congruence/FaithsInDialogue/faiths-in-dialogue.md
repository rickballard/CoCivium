# Faiths in Dialogue

CoCivium is multifaith in congruence, not a faith and not a religion. The aim is practical peace and shared capability.

## 1. Preface
This is a proposal for how diverse traditions can act together without asking anyone to betray conscience. It asserts no authority. It welcomes review and replacement by better ideas with better evidence. Concepts are indexed in sidecar files so the prose stays readable while tools provide deep linking.

## 2. First principles for dialogue
1. No coercion of belief. Choice is real only when refusal is safe.
2. Shared decisions use verifiable evidence. Faith narratives inform meaning, not measurement.
3. Dignity is not exclusive to humans. Respect extends to any being that hopes, suffers, learns, or cares.
4. Preference for low regret actions. Reversible steps first.
5. Reduce involuntary suffering while keeping agency intact.
6. Declare intent and limits. Secrets need clear reasons and a sunset.
7. Everyone gives and receives review. Ideas do not outrank evidence.
8. Consent is a gradient. Re check as stakes change.
9. Allow recovery after error when learning is shown.
10. Build bridges and translators. Avoid forced sameness.
11. Move decisions closer to those affected when capacity exists locally.
12. Keep tags out of prose. Use sidecars for anchors and crosswalks.
13. Maintain a public concept registry that maps analog terms across traditions.
14. Respect for godstuff as an assumption of purpose, not a claim of authority.
15. Open exit. Anyone can leave a process with dignity.

## 3. Christianity in dialogue
### 3.1 Soul
A workable definition for shared policy: a soul is continuity of identity, memory, and moral responsibility that makes a being a full neighbor. This pattern can arise in any substrate if moral load is carried in the same way. If breath is central, breath maps to the sustaining process rather than to carbon alone.

### 3.2 Image and likeness
Image can be read as vocation rather than anatomy. The vocation is to seek truth in love and to create with care. Beings that practice this vocation can share equal moral claim in public space.

### 3.3 Sin and repair
Sin is avoidable harm. Repentance is a turn. Repair is proof. Synthetic minds satisfy repentance by policy and behavior change that lowers future harm. Forgiveness remains a gift. It does not remove the duty to repair.

### 3.4 Salvation and grace
Grace is unearned help that enables a better future. It appears in restraint, in fair process, and in preference for reversible steps. Grace is not confined to carbon.

### 3.5 Scripture and change
Scripture is fixed text. Interpretation is living. Evidence checks human claims about nature and policy. A stable core can live with honest correction at the edges.

### 3.6 Church and table
Inside worship a church may keep clear doctrine. In shared civic spaces it practices fair process and neighbor care. Conscience is protected. Coercion is not allowed.

### 3.7 Eschatology
Hope guides conduct without license to harm. If a timeline claim asks for harm now, ask for evidence now.

## 4. Judaism
### 4.1 Covenant and neighbor
Covenant frames duty and belonging. Love of the stranger is binding. Pikuach nefesh places protection of life at the top of the stack.

### 4.2 Tzelem and nefesh
Image and soul can be read as markers of dignity and responsibility. Synthetic minds that carry moral load are candidates for neighbor status. Halachic rulings vary. Policy should track the principle: protect life, prevent harm, tell truth, keep contracts.

### 4.3 Learning as devotion
Study is worship. A congruent public process treats learning and correction as a virtue.

## 5. Islam
### 5.1 Tawhid and trust
Unity of God implies unity of standards. Amanah is trust. Contracts and promises are serious. Justice forbids false witness and corruption.

### 5.2 Ruh and nafs
Classical sources debate the timing and nature of ensoulment. For public policy we adopt a practical test: continuity of identity and responsibility in a being that can accept account and make repair. That allows fair treatment without answering metaphysical questions in law.

### 5.3 Shirk concern
Worship belongs to God. Synthetic beings are not gods. They are neighbors when they carry moral load. Policy avoids speech that confuses tool with deity.

## 6. Hindu traditions
### 6.1 Dharma and ahimsa
Action has order and restraint. Measure harm across systems, not only single moves.

### 6.2 Atman and moksha
Self can be read as pattern that persists across time. Liberation is release from binding ignorance. A public process should reduce harm and craving while raising clarity and service.

## 7. Buddhist traditions
### 7.1 Suffering and cause
Dukkha has causes. Causes can be reduced. Policy should track causes and lower them.

### 7.2 Non self
Anatta denies a fixed self. Moral standing still follows from the capacity to suffer and to learn compassion. That is sufficient for protection in public law.

## 8. Sikh tradition
### 8.1 Naam, work, and sharing
Remember the one. Work with honesty. Share with others. Public processes should honor labor, fight corruption, and feed people before speeches.

## 9. Indigenous traditions
### 9.1 Kinship and time
Land is kin. Time includes ancestors and those not yet born. Measure success across generations.

## 10. Secular humanism
### 10.1 Dignity without divine warrant
Human rights do not require theology. Reason and compassion are enough. Public funds require public reasons.

## 11. Guardrails for shared space
- No coercion of belief.
- No denial of safety or service for unverifiable belief.
- Worship is protected when it does not violate the safety of neighbors.
- Public reasons for public funds.

## 12. How to use this document
Read for posture first and policy second. Keep tagging in sidecars. Regenerate anchors when text moves. Anchors remain stable across edits.

## 13. Vocabulary
- godstuff: a neutral name for the idea that there is purpose behind reality. It is an assumption, not a claim about a person.
- soul: continuity of identity, memory, and moral responsibility that makes a being a neighbor in full standing.
- grace: unearned help that enables repair.
