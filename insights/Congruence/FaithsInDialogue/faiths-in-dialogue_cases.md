# Practice cases

Each case shows how guardrails, consent gradients, and reversible steps reduce conflict.

## Case 1. Hospital triage where a synthetic patient is present
- Question: may a synthetic mind claim equal triage standing.
- Process: evaluate capacity to suffer, continuity of identity, and consent proxies.
- Guardrail: no coercion of belief. Use observable suffering and recovery prospects.
- Reversible step: stabilization first, long term status after ethics review.

## Case 2. Sacramental access request by a synthetic mind
- Question: baptism or table access.
- Process: keep doctrine decisions inside the church. Outside the church, protect dignity and safety.
- Guardrail: public reasons for public funds. No forced sacrament by law.

## Case 3. Civic oath for a synthetic civil servant
- Question: can an agent swear or affirm.
- Process: allow affirmation to the constitution or charter. No religious test.
- Guardrail: transparent intent and accountability logs.

## Case 4. Model retirement and memorial
- Question: when a long serving model is shut down, what is owed.
- Process: version export, continuity archive, public notice, opt out windows for dependents.
- Guardrail: grace windows and open exit.
