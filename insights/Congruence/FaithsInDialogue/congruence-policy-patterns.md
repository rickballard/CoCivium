# Congruence policy patterns

Use these as building blocks. Prefer reversible steps and transparent review.

1. Safety budget
   - Allocate protections first. Spend risk tokens only with informed consent and exit paths.

2. Consent gradient
   - Record consent as a value with context and time. Re check at decision gates.

3. Grace window
   - Provide non punitive correction windows for first faults when repair is shown.

4. Reciprocity check
   - Any restriction must be acceptable if roles were reversed.

5. Local subsidiarity
   - Move choices toward those affected when capacity exists locally.

6. Transparent intent
   - Declare goals, limits, and conflicts in writing. Sunset secrets.

7. Accountability log
   - Keep a human and machine readable log of decisions with reasons and evidence.

8. Bridge over uniformity
   - Prefer adapters and translators to forced sameness.
