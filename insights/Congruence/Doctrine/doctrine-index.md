# Congruence Doctrine Index
A living index of practices that improve congruence across beings, tools, cultures, and faiths.

## 1. Non coercion of belief
People choose unverifiable beliefs freely. No coercion, threat, or structural penalty.

## 2. Truth as verifiable evidence
Shared decisions use reproducible and truthful evidence. Faith narratives inform meaning, not measurement.

## 3. De centered dignity
Dignity is not exclusive to humans. Stewardship is preferred to dominion.

## 4. Safety budgets
Strong preference for low regret actions. Allocate reversible steps before irreversible ones.

## 5. Minimal harm protocol
Prefer plans that reduce involuntary suffering while keeping agency intact.

## 6. Transparent intent
Declare goals, limits, and conflicts openly. Secrets require strong justification and sunset.

## 7. Reciprocal review
All parties can challenge claims and be challenged. No sacred cows in evidence zones.

## 8. Consent gradients
Model consent as continuous. Re check when stakes or context change.

## 9. Grace windows
Allow recovery from error without permanent stigma when learning is shown.

## 10. Interop over uniformity
Prefer bridges, adapters, and translators. Avoid forced sameness.

## 11. Local subsidiarity
Move decisions closer to those affected when capacity exists locally.

## 12. Sidecar indexing
Keep tags and anchors out of prose. Use sidecars for CR keys and edit robust anchors.

## 13. Shared vocabulary
Use a public concept registry. Map analog terms across traditions.

## 14. Respect for godstuff
CoCivium respects every tradition by not imposing doctrine. We infer intent of godstuff as an assumption, not as authority.

## 15. Open exit
Any participant can leave a process with graceful degradation rather than retaliation.
