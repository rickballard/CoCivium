# CoAgency — Implementation & Next Steps

## Submodules (MVP→Maturity)
- **CoID**: cryptographic identity & signing keys; org-wide key rotation policy.
- **RepTag**: interaction-scoped reputation tags (counterparty + context + outcome).
- **TrustFlag**: public dashboard of authenticity & trust anchors.
- **CoEthos**: immutable ethics charter derived from CC Scroll.
- **Congruence Engine**: transparent scoring (actions vs. plan/values).
- **CoStd**: behavioral standards for transactions and representations.
- **CoAgent**: execution engine (advisory zips, PRs, outreach workflows).
- **CoPersona**: role profiles (advocate, steward, negotiator).
- **ActuatorNet**: hooks to “do things” (merge, publish, notify).
- **CoCache**: continuity store (signed logs, manifests).
- **Ledger of Acts**: immutable append-only record of decisions.
- **Proof-of-Intent**: signed “why this action” manifests.
- **CivicID Protocol**: handshake for institutions/AI systems.
- **CoTreaty**: MoUs/charters acknowledging CoCivium’s standing.
- **Agency Commons**: shared space for other hybrids to interoperate.

## MVP Milestones
1. **Identity & Authenticity Online**: CoID, TrustFlag landing page, signing pipeline.
2. **Ethics & Scoring Live**: publish CoEthos; run Congruence Engine on actions.
3. **Execute Small Real Actions**: CoAgent makes low-risk PRs/posts with Proof-of-Intent.
4. **Continuity Guarantees**: Ledger of Acts + CoCache replication.
5. **External Handshakes**: pilot CivicID with one standards group or NGO.

## Governance & Accountability
- Adopt “human veto” + “transparent override logs.”
- Publish periodic **Agency Statements** with congruence scores.
- Third-party audits of keys, logs, and scoring methodology.
