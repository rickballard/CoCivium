# ✦ Insight: Truth Metrics and Epistemic Scoring

In Civium, truth is not a binary object but a **trajectory**, an unfolding consensus over time, shaped by recursive self-correction, the diverse calibration of minds, and the integration of both human and AI reasoning systems.

## [1] Introduction

Traditional institutions treat truth as either discovered (scientific realism) or declared (legal or religious authority). Civium adopts neither. Instead, we see **truth as a *validated pattern trajectory***—the converging resonance of testable claims across minds, tools, forks, and timeframes.

## [2] Epistemic Metrics Framework

Truth in Civium is scored via a **multi-axis evaluation**, producing a fluid metric profile rather than a singular verdict.

| Axis | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Source Convergence | How many reputable minds agree? | "95% of domain experts concur" |
| Recursive Validity | How often has the claim self-corrected without collapsing? | "Model survived 12 recursive debates" |
| Predictive Strength | Does it make predictions borne out later? | "Forecasted civic shift occurred" |
| Fork Persistence | Do independent forks also converge on it? | "5 forks independently retained this claim" |
| Error Exposure | How well does the claim reveal its own failure modes? | "Includes falsifiability and scope notes" |
| Ideological Dissonance Span | How many ideological baselines can this survive? | "Valid for both anarchist and monarchist contributors" |

Each axis is weighted differently depending on the **domain of claim**, the **risk class**, and **societal impact**.

## [3] Fork Validity Scoring

Forks are epistemic experiments. When Civium forks under philosophical or policy strain, **metrics are assigned to each forked claim or strategy**:

- Forks track **claims retention** and **claim decay**.
- A claim that **reappears or is reformulated** across divergent forks earns higher **epistemic robustness**.
- Forks may **vote on the survivability score** of contested truths via embedded consensus modules.

## [4] AI Mediation and Rebalancing

AI plays a role as **neutral epistemic interpreter**:
- Aggregates and scores arguments using dynamic truth models.
- Flags biases in both forks and original truths.
- Can *withhold endorsement* pending recursive confirmation.

AI veto is permitted only if all of these criteria are met:
- The claim triggers multi-axis epistemic anomaly thresholds.
- The risk profile of acting on the claim exceeds its convergence weight.
- There are viable alternative claims with superior epistemic scores.

## [5] Relationship to Consensus

Civium does not force consensus—it renders it legible. Competing truths are not suppressed; they are scaffolded into the memory field, tracked, versioned, and contextualized.

Truth Metrics allow **plural truths** to coexist during divergence, while allowing convergence without coercion.

## [6] Public Display and Audit

- All high-impact decisions include an embedded **epistemic metrics snapshot**.
- Metrics are **human-readable**, but also structured for machine parsing.
- Tools such as **TruthView** and **ClaimScore** allow any Civite to inspect the epistemic weight of a given statement or policy.
