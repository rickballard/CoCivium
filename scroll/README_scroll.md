# README: Scroll Folder (Cognocarta Consenti)

This folder contains **Civium’s constitutional scroll**—the Cognocarta Consenti—serving as the living backbone of the Civium framework.

Unlike support documents, which may be speculative, procedural, or interpretive, this scroll is the core declaration of values, rights, relational logic, and binding harmonics. It is **recursive**, **non-final**, and designed to evolve through the minds and contexts that engage it.

The scroll is structured into coherent sections (e.g., *Genexis*, *Principles*, *Consent*, *Resolution*), and each section reflects a different aspect of collective sentience and governance.  

Refer to [`/meta/DOC_CATEGORIES.md`](../meta/DOC_CATEGORIES.md) for Civium’s document classification logic, and to [`README_CIVIUM_AI.md`](../README_CIVIUM_AI.md) for deeper context on AI participation.

**Note:** Only the Cognocarta Consenti resides here. Other design texts, insights, and commentary reside in their respective folders.
