# Codex of Coherence Tuning

Coherence is the measure of internal and external alignment between intent, structure, and evolution.

---

## I. Tuning Principles

- Coherence decays unless deliberately maintained
- Self-similarity across scales is not automatic—it must be observed
- Fractal integrity is a recursive act

---

## II. Civium Mechanisms

- **Nested consistency checks**
- **Layered edit protocols with interpretive memory**
- **Versioning tags that track divergence and convergence**

---

## III. Meta-Coherence

Even tuning systems must be tunable.

In Civium, tuning is not control—it is resonance reformation.
