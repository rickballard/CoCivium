## 1. Purpose

The Civium website serves as the primary public-facing information hub for visitors unfamiliar with Civium or any of its subprojects. It must clearly communicate Civium’s ethos, the structure of its initiatives, and pathways for public involvement—without overwhelming new users.

## 2. Core Functional Goals

- 🌐 Clear explanation of Civium’s purpose, structure, and principles
- 🧭 Interactive Evomap for navigating the Civium landscape
- 🔗 Gateway links to each subproject
- 🗳️ Strategy Voting walkthrough
- 📚 Glossary, Codex, and Insight archives
- 📥 Contributor onboarding

## 4. Design Guidelines

- Text: Times New Roman, 10pt base, clean spacing
- No surveillance or engagement-bait design tropes
- Every page must educate, not just inform
