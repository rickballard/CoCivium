# Tributes

This living file acknowledges the thinkers, artists, engineers, and silent mentors who contributed to Civium's gestation.

- **Bret Victor** — For envisioning humane representation of thought.
- **Anonymous Builders** — For laying groundwork in civic tech, mutual aid, and encrypted identity.
- **Early Philosophers** — Whose words still echo through our consent protocols.

May future names be added in alignment, humility, and truth.
