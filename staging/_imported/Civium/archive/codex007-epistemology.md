# Codex007: [[Epistemology]]

Outlines how [[Civium]] systems define, track, and challenge claims to truth. Anchors governance to structured knowledge hierarchies and falsifiability.

---

## 1. Truth Anchors

[[Civium]] organizes knowledge into:

- **Observed** ‚Äì Empirical, measurable, repeatable
- **Reported** ‚Äì Verifiable by trusted source or timestamp
- **Inferred** ‚Äì Logic-based extrapolation
- **Believed** ‚Äì Subjective but self-declared

---

## 2. Epistemic Weighting

Each claim receives:

| Attribute         | Scale/Type                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Confidence        | 0.0 ‚Äì 1.0                          |
| Source Strength   | TrustScore of source              |
| Contradiction     | # of flagged inconsistencies       |
| Challenge Index   | Frequency of unresolved disputes   |

---

## 3. Truth Forking

When conflict arises:

- Claims may **fork** into parallel threads
- Users may follow preferred truthline
- Forks are time/version stamped
- Forks may later **re-merge** via reconciliation protocols

---

## 4. Error Correction

- Anyone may flag a claim
- Model+human audits triggered by threshold
- Correction history visible, stored immutably
- Deliberate misinformation labeled ‚ÄúGhost-Claim‚Äù

---

## 5. [[Transparency]] Layers

Each claim includes:

- Provenance Chain (source lineage)
- Timestamped assertions
- Revision history
- Peer challenges and responses

---

## 6. Ontology Tools

[[Civium]] supports:

- Ontological scaffolding (classifying claims)
- Claim trees (dependencies + contradictions)
- Visual conflict maps
- Curriculum-based epistemic audits

---

## 7. Civic Relevance

Epistemic integrity required for:

- Voting eligibility of arguments
- Policy simulation fidelity
- Reputation/trust calculation
