# Codex006: Debate Systems

Defines the infrastructure for structured debate within [[Civium]], including adversarial models, role-played perspectives, and AI-augmented facilitation.

---

## 1. Core Concepts

- **Deliberative Engine**: Automated assembly of diverse positions
- **Role Avatars**: Pre-defined philosophical, ethical, or demographic standpoints
- **Meta-AI**: Facilitator overseeing tone, clarity, and balance
- **Public Ledger**: Debate outcomes stored, versioned, re-auditable

---

## 2. Modes of Argument

| Mode          | Description                             |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Socratic      | Question-based probing                  |
| Empathic      | Perspective-switching synthesis         |
| Adversarial   | Conflict-based truth pressure           |
| Recursive     | Nested or temporal replay               |
| Satirical     | Parody to expose logical absurdity      |

---

## 3. AI Moderation Tools

- Conflict detection (volume, tone, fallacy alerts)
- Bias triangulation using external audits
- Emotional temperature tracking
- Sanity anchors (reminders of shared axioms)

---

## 4. Role Avatars

Participants (human or AI) may adopt:

- Rationalist
- Libertarian
- Theist
- Centrist Moderate
- Youth Future-Holder
- Marginalized Experience
- Planetary Steward

Each avatar includes:

- Primary worldview
- Common heuristics
- Known blindspots

---

## 5. Civic Debates

Civic issues must:

- Include citizen voice prioritization
- Use multivote outcomes (e.g., Ranked Choice + MeritRank)
- Auto-generate summary briefs
- Log unresolved tensions for escalation

---

## 6. Export Formats

| Format       | Use Case                  |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| TL;DR        | Public awareness          |
| Summary Card | Policymaker briefings     |
| Transcript   | [[Transparency]] archive      |
| Ontology Map | AI learning + consensus   |

---

## 7. Emergence Feedback

Debates may trigger:

- New role archetypes
- Detection of unmodeled bias
- Recursive debates about debate rules
