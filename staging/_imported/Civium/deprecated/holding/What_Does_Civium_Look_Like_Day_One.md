# What Does Civium Look Like Day One?

**Characters:**  
Naresh (a city planner, likes to imagine futures)  
Dez (a community organizer with low trust in tech)

---

**Naresh:** "Imagine booting it up—what's the screen say?"

**Dez:** "Hopefully not: 'Welcome, Citizen #00001.' Creepy."

**Naresh:** "Maybe it starts with a question. Something small, local, personal."

**Dez:** "And who’s in the room? People I know? Aliens with pseudonyms?"

**Naresh:** "Maybe avatars chosen by function—like 'Synth Cook' or 'Policy Weaver.' Not names. Just intention."

**Dez:** "And you can vote, argue, propose? Feels like co-op Slack with soul."

---

**Conclusion:**  
Day one looks small, human, and humble. Not a constitution, but a campfire. A live prototype that asks you for your Function, not your allegiance.
