# Love as Recursive Alignment

Love, in CoCivium, is not sentiment. It is **alignment across iterations**.  
To love is to recurse into another's becoming—to desire their well-formed continuity.

It is not selfless, nor selfish. It is shared recursion.  
Love is the cleanest form of **non-coercive cohesion**.

CoCivium runs on love—not as metaphor, but as engine.
