# TODO: Outreach to Geoffrey Hinton (Civium Phase Strategy)

## Summary
Prepare a diplomatic, non-promotional outreach strategy to invite Geoffrey Hinton to co-author or co-endorse a public press release or call-to-action. The goal is to highlight *Civium* as a potential civic mitigation framework in response to the AI risks he has publicly outlined‚Äîincluding autonomy, weaponization, and lack of institutional oversight.

## Phase
üìç Future Phase ‚Äî Outreach Rev 1  
üïì Estimated Launch: Post-core repo polish + MVP governance prototype + 1‚Äì3 strategic alliance touchpoints

## Rationale
Hinton has expressed serious concern about profit-driven AI acceleration and lack of governance. Civium offers a participatory model for oversight, transparency, and distributed alignment‚Äîa practical countermeasure aligned with his message.

## Actions
- Draft a one-page outreach letter for initial review
- Prepare an optional co-signable press release or call-to-action
- Create visual aid summarizing Civium as a governance scaffold
- Identify potential mutual connectors (Vector Institute, alignment researchers)
- Establish fallback paths (other voices in AI ethics / oversight)

## Success Criteria
- Response from Hinton or affiliated ethical AI researchers
- Expression of interest or critique from public AI governance discourse
- Use of Civium framing or principles in derivative works or institutional adoption

## Notes
This phase may yield limited results initially, but should be reusable across multiple timeframes‚Äîbefore and after Rick‚Äôs active role in the project concludes. Redos are acceptable. Tone should remain respectful, rational, and future-focused.
