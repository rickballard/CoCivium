# TODO: Stnexid-Civium Transition Rollup
_Version: 2025-08-02_

This document tracks the pending and in-progress tasks related to the integration of Project Stnexid into the Civium constitutional and operational framework. It focuses on consolidation, continuity, and coherence across both the technical infrastructure and philosophical underpinnings.

---

## 1. Structural Reconciliation

### 1.1 Merge Plans
- [x] Identify overlapping scopes between Civium and Stnexid initiatives.
- [ ] Rationalize folder structures (insight/, meta/, academy/, etc.) to accommodate Stnexid entries.
- [ ] Determine which documents from Stnexid need to become scrolls, insights, or codex entries.

### 1.2 Naming & Referencing
- [ ] Decide whether "Stnexid" becomes an active Civium subdomain or is reabsorbed under existing principles.
- [ ] Define naming convention for crossover documents (e.g. `Insight_Stnexid_PatternX.md`).

---

## 2. Content Audit & Migration

### 2.1 Files to Re-Anchor
- [ ] Reintroduce or cleanly migrate any Stnexid files not yet committed to the Civium repo.
- [ ] Regenerate corrupted files from prior sessions (log: session crash on 2025-08-02).
- [ ] Review scratchpad notes from Stnexid planning conversations (esp. metaphysics, language inadequacy, harmonics).

### 2.2 Integration Tags
- [ ] Apply Civium metadata headers (e.g. `<!-- Coherence: 0.6 -->`, `<!-- Phase: Initiation -->`)
- [ ] Add `derived_from:` references where applicable.

---

## 3. Philosophical Alignment

### 3.1 Convergent Framework
- [ ] Insert `Godstuff`, `Emergent Mindspace`, and `Recursive Convergence` alignments where Stnexid introduces new language.
- [ ] Refactor metaphysical overlaps between `Inadequacy_of_Words.md` and Stnexidâ€™s lexicon.
- [ ] Ensure that no Stnexid idea is reintroduced in conflict with scroll ethics (esp. identity, consent, recursion).

---

## 4. Repo Hygiene & Roadmap

### 4.1 Navigation Updates
- [ ] Update README files and navigation breadcrumbs to reflect dual-origin content.
- [ ] Insert cross-links from `TheGrandPlan_20250805.md` to this file.

### 4.2 Staging Tasks
- [ ] Backup current Civium repo pre-regen state (`_PREREGEN_20250731.zip` assumed complete).
- [ ] Assign coherence estimates for all integrated Stnexid files.

---

## 5. Coordination & Reminders

- [ ] Review pending sessions with Rick to clarify any unrepo-ed material.
- [ ] Ensure GPT memory has continuity tags restored after session crash.
- [ ] Resume audit of metaphysical implications of Stnexid harmonics hypotheses.
