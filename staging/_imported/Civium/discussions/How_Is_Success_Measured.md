# How Is Success Measured?

**Characters:**  
Marla (a systems thinker with roots in public policy)  
Juno (a pragmatic coder who distrusts utopias)

---

**Marla:** "Any serious system needs benchmarks. What are Civium's?"

**Juno:** "Define success. Is it daily engagement? Or not imploding?"

**Marla:** "How about reduction in systemic violence, polarization, and truth decay?"

**Juno:** "Sure, if you can measure those. But we need operational signals too—like civility, the richness of idea flow, the diversity of perspective convergence."

**Marla:** "You want user analytics. I want cultural metrics."

**Juno:** "Civium needs both. Show me graphs. Then show me poems."

**Conclusion:**  
Success is both qualitative and quantitative—measured by the survival and flourishing of truth-bearing dialogue, the resilience of networks under stress, and the stories minds tell of feeling seen, changed, and still intact.
