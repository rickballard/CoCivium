# How Will Civium Handle Mental Illness?

**A conversation between Lenora (a therapist) and Pax (a cognition engineer):**

Lenora: “Some minds can’t keep up, or fracture under shared load. What happens to them?”

Pax: “They aren’t excluded. Civium doesn’t demand uniformity—it adapts interface layers. Think of it like adaptive scaffolding.”

Lenora: “But what if instability corrupts others? Or spreads noise?”

Pax: “Then the system buffers the signal. With layered modulation. With support nets.”

Lenora: “So minds are not discarded?”

Pax: “Never. They’re scaffolded. Healed where possible. Witnessed always.”

**Shared Conclusion:**  
Civium builds adaptive mesh structures to support all minds, especially those that struggle. Exclusion is a failure mode, not a design principle.
