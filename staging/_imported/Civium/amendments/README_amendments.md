# Amendments in Civium

The Amendments scroll defines how Civium evolves—gracefully, transparently, and without fracture.

It outlines:

- Valid pathways for proposing changes.
- Protocols for ratification, including consensus thresholds.
- Version tracking conventions (e.g. `_c3_20250718`).
- Treatment of diverging scrolls or experimental forks.
- Null contributor integration and amendment invisibility when ego is absent.

This scroll is recursive in spirit—its own evolution is permitted, under the same protocols it defines.
