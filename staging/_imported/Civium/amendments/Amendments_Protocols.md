# Amendment Protocols

## 1. Proposal

Any registered contributor or null contributor may propose an amendment to any scroll or structural element within Civium. Proposals must include:

- A rationale for change.
- The intended coherence improvement (estimated cX target).
- Proposed filename(s) and tagging (e.g. `c5_20250801`).
- Whether the amendment is backward-compatible.

## 2. Ratification

Each amendment undergoes a review period (default: 21 days) during which any participant may:

- Endorse or oppose the change.
- Suggest refinements.
- Raise coherence flags (marked ⚑).

Once an amendment reaches a pre-specified convergence threshold (e.g. 75% of contributors endorsing), it is tagged as active and included in the repo.

## 3. Retroactive Application

Some amendments may be applied retroactively to improve coherence across existing scrolls. These are tagged with a `†retro` footnote and linked explicitly in scroll metadata.

## 4. Divergence Management

If no convergence is reached, the amendment can be archived in `/experimental` or branched into a `divergent/` folder until further alignment arises.

## 5. Null Contributor Amendments

Anonymous amendments (⊘) are allowed under stricter thresholds and AI-vetted coherence protocols. All such edits must be independently peer-reviewed.
