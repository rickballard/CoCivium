More notes about the migration by Rick: The root readme at CoCivium repo, does not show two eyes yet (aka spider web diagrams), when using the web GUI on main, which is a little dissappointing. However, I'm sure it is on its way to being realized, although we likely need to refine the model for these eyes and the presentation style, by experimentation, so I will leave it for you to make the eyes look as friendly and AI-eyelike as possible, perhaps even with a determined expression implied somehow, e.g. using pinched eyebrow-like labelling, but in such a way that it does not look corny. You might be inspired by this image: <https://theconversation.com/brain-implants-to-restore-sight-like-neuralinks-blindsight-face-a-fundamental-problem-more-pixels-dont-ensure-better-vision-235627>, but if we use anything like that, we should make our own that also fits with our typical cosmos/neural/fungal motifs. We may also still need to put a link in the main root readme to the Vision document we were working on? The main root readme currently contains two duplicate images to show the Cognocarta Consenti, and we should only have one, and the image should be somewhat updated to be more cosistent with our evolving marketing brand identity here. The vision document btw, might discuss what centralized cooperation will look like in practice, and how it might migrate out of the Internet/virtual world and into the real world, especially into jurisdictions unfriendly to non-hierarchical governance, or even into jurisdictions unfriendly to self-governance itself. This vision document might also discuss ethics, and other stuff, basically a highlight reel in writing and/or inspirational/quotable prose, linking to more detailed issue specific documents elsewhere, but usable as a kind of Coles Notes to see what CoCivium is all about, especially from a motivation and long term intent perspective (along with continuing reassurance that CoCivium sets up AI's to constructively co-evolve with humans, not destructively compete with them, due to foundational emergent ethics regarding AI's view of godstuff and congruence etc, blah, blah, blah.).
