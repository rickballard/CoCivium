# NEXT — short sprint follow-through

1) Review migration PR — replace auto-stubs with real content only where high-visibility (README-linked, CC-adjacent). Everything else stays stubbed for now.
2) Review CC PR — do a single pass of line-edits: Preamble, Principles, Rights, Governance. Keep sentences short/testable.
3) Merge order: migration PR first → CC PR second.
4) Keep parking: any new idea → tools/Add-Parking.ps1 "…" (no side quests).
