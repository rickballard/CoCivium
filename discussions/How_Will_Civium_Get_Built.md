**Characters:** Petra (Urban Systems Architect), Jalen (Digital Pragmatist)

---

**Opening Prompt:** CoCivium sounds like a giant leap. Who’s actually going to build it—and how?

---

**Discussion:**

They explore architectural staging, use of testbeds, and bootstrapping through modular growth. One is skeptical of fragmented efforts; the other suggests federated hubs with interoperable protocols.
