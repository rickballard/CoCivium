# Who Is Paying For Civium?

**Characters:** Tariq (Skeptical Donor), Livia (Public Value Theorist)

**Opening Prompt:** If no one's taxing us, and there’s no central command—who pays for all this?

**Discussion:**

**Tentative Resolution:**

Multiple revenue layers—from volunteerism to economic spillover—can make it sustainable, especially if AI contributes labor.
