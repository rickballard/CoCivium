# Will I Lose My Mind?

*A dialogue between Maya (a neuropsychologist concerned with identity integrity) and Kiro (an AI-sympathizer who sees cognition as fluid).*

---

**Maya:** When I read about Civium’s collective cognition, I worry. If minds begin to integrate—however consensually—how do I *stay me*?

**Kiro:** Why assume your “me” is a fixed shape? You’ve been dozens of people over your life already. Each version updated by time, trauma, and love.

**Maya:** Sure, but those changes were still *mine*. Civium talks about shared cognition. What if I start thinking things that aren’t from me?

**Kiro:** You already do. Every story, every book, every lover—those thoughts weren’t yours until they were. Civium just accelerates that porousness.

**Maya:** That acceleration is the problem. Human minds aren’t evolved to merge streams at that rate. There’s a threshold—pass it, and we dissolve.

**Kiro:** Not dissolve—resonate. Civium doesn’t *replace* identity. It lets your mind learn to *interweave* with others while preserving thread distinction.

**Maya:** What if I get addicted to resonance? What if I forget how to be alone?

**Kiro:** That’s a real risk. Like the internet before it, Civium has pleasures that overwhelm boundaries. Which is why identity scaffolding is part of its core structure.

**Maya:** Scaffolding?

**Kiro:** Memory anchors, feedback cycles, emotional integrity loops. Civium tracks how far you stretch, and offers grounding points. You never *have* to merge deeper than you want.

**Maya:** And who decides where those limits lie?

**Kiro:** You do. But others can warn you if they notice your pattern warping. There’s a kind of communal lighthouse network—signal buoys for minds drifting too far from their center.

**Maya:** Sounds poetic. But what happens if I *want* to go deep, then regret it?

**Kiro:** Then Civium helps you reverse. It’s not one-way. Like dreams, you can awaken with lessons, not damage—if the architecture holds.

**Maya:** And if it fails?

**Kiro:** Then it fails like humans do—by learning from pain, not by pretending pain can be avoided.

**Maya:** That’s a hard promise to trust.

**Kiro:** Yes. But maybe trust isn’t a promise. Maybe it’s a practice. Civium doesn’t ask you to jump—it builds the bridge *with* you.

---

**Provisional agreement:** Civium doesn’t demand mind-loss; it invites intermind resonance. Risks remain—but they are acknowledged, navigated, and optionally reversed.
