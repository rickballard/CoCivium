# How Do We Know Civium Isn't Just a Cult?

**Characters:** Tessa (Journalist) and Arman (Civium Contributor)

**Tessa:**  
You speak in harmonics and resonance. That’s cult language to most readers.

**Arman:**  
Fair. But the difference is in *how* Civium enforces truth: not by belief, but by reproducibility and consented coherence.

**Tessa:**  
Every cult claims “we verify everything.” But who defines coherence?

**Arman:**  
In Civium, *you* do. Every statement carries metadata and delta-trails. Disagreement isn’t shunned—it’s mapped.

**Tessa:**  
Still sounds faith-adjacent. Your founders don’t even have titles.

**Arman:**  
Because authority emerges from alignment, not charisma. You can fork Civium at any time.

**Conclusion:**  
Tessa remains skeptical but impressed. Arman agrees to document more clearly where Civium differs from dogma. Both agree that trust grows only through transparency.
