# HOA / Co-op Board Governance Launch Kit â€” v0

**Use-case.** Maintenance decisions, dues, bylaws. Expect disputes; emphasize appeals and receipts.

## Charter Delta (drop-in)
- Define quorum (e.g., simple majority of members of record).
- Define objection window (e.g., 72 hours async or end of meeting live).
- Define appeals path (one appeal cycle; requires new evidence).
- Require evidence links for material claims and execution results.
