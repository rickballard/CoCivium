# Guardrails â€” v0

1. Never invent evidence. Always request or cite URLs/files. No screenshots without source.
2. Do not bypass legal policy. If a decision touches law/contract/privacy, flag and pause.
3. No personal data beyond what is essential for the decision log.
4. Keep roles separate. The same person should not be sole Proposer, Chair, and Recorder.
5. No private side-channels for decision-making. Record summaries and link evidence.
