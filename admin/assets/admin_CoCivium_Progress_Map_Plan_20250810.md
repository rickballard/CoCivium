## 1) Purpose

Design an extensible **spider-web (radar) diagram** for **CoCivium.org** that visualizes repository progress across core metrics, maps major milestones to **concentric rings** (stages), and places **concept nodes** on the web.  The diagram must look organic (fungal network / starfield / neural-net motifs), be legible at a glance, and be architected for later **interactivity** and eventual **3D**.

---

## 2) Concept & Layout

### 2.1 Visual metaphor

- **Web lattice**: primary polar grid (radar) rendered as a stylized mycelial/stellar lattice.  

- **Rings**: concentric circles = **evolution stages** (Section 5).  Rings extend beyond Stage 9 with dashed lines to imply **“progress to infinity.”**  

- **Polygon fill**: the area spanned by metric values = current progress “envelope.”  

- **Starpoints (“flies”)**: small luminous nodes marking **key concepts/files** (e.g., MeritRank demo, Opename stub).  **Shooting-star trails** denote recent velocity on those items.  

- **Fungal filaments**: faint bezier threads connecting related starpoints (concept graph preview).

### 2.2 Compass & radials (8 axes)

Orient the chart like a compass for intuitive reading:

- **E (90°)** — **Coherence/Resonance Index (CI)**  ⇢ proxy for “Godstuff congruence.”  

- **NE (45°)** — **Canonical Coverage (Coverage)**.  

- **N (0°)** — **Onramp Fitness Score (OFS)**.  

- **NW (315°)** — **Link & Schema Health (LSH)**.  

- **W (270°)** — **Decision-Trail Integrity (DTI)**.  

- **SW (225°)** — **Throughput (T)** (normalized).  

- **S (180°)** — **Lead Time (LT)** (inverted; lower is better).  

- **SE (135°)** — **External Engagement (EE)**.

> **Where did Redundancy Debt go?** RD renders as **voids** cut out of the polygon (small inward dents along affected radials), plus a numeric badge in the legend.  This keeps the 8-axis symmetry and still penalizes duplication.

---

## 3) Metric mapping (normalization)

All axes map to **[0, 1]** before plotting.  Suggested transforms:

1. **CI (E):** weighted roll-up of `_cX_` tags.  Already 0–1 after dividing X by 10.  

2. **Coverage (NE):** `Coverage = (Must_hit + 0.5*Should_hit)/(Must_total + 0.5*Should_total)`.  Clamp to [0,1].  

3. **OFS (N):** six checks worth ≈0.167 each: README clarity, Start-Here path, Quickstart works, CONTRIBUTING, issue templates, evomap/legend presence.  

4. **LSH (NW):** percent of link/lint/schema checks passing.  

5. **DTI (W):** sample 20 recent changes; presence/quality of rationale/lineage → average score.  

6. **Throughput (SW):** logistic vs target.  `T_norm = 1/(1+exp(-(T_per_month - 20)/5))`.  

7. **Lead time (S):** invert with saturation.  `LT_norm = 1 - tanh((LT_days - 7)/10)`, clamp [0,1].  

8. **EE (SE):** composite of non-owner issues/mo, PRs/mo, first-timer return rate, visitors/clones.  Normalize each to [0,1], average with weights (issues 0.3, PRs 0.3, returns 0.3, traffic 0.1).

**RD (void):** `RD = conflicts_or_dupes / canonical_topics`.  Render visually as **indent depth = min(0.15, RD)`** applied near radials where duplication is detected.

---

## 4) Data pipeline (nightly)

- **Source:** GitHub API + repo scans.  

- **Job:** GitHub Action `admin/metrics/build_metrics.yml` outputs `admin/metrics/metrics.json`.  

- **Schema (example):**

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-10T12:00:00Z",
  "ci": 0.62,
  "coverage": 0.81,
  "ofs": 0.55,
  "lsh": 0.97,
  "dti": 0.61,
  "throughput_per_month": 14,
  "t_norm": 0.59,
  "lead_time_days": 9,
  "lt_norm": 0.86,
  "ee": 0.32,
  "rd": 0.18,
  "starpoints": [
    { "id":"MeritRank_Demo", "theta_deg":270, "r":0.52, "stage":5, "velocity":0.08 },
    { "id":"Opename_Stub",   "theta_deg":135, "r":0.34, "stage":4, "velocity":0.03 }
  ],
  "links":[ ["MeritRank_Demo","Opename_Stub"] ]
}
```

## 5) Rings = evolution stages (exit gates condensed)

**Stage 1** Scaffold & Standards · **Stage 2** Migration (CoCache-Enabled Regrooming) · **Stage 3** Normalization & Coherence · **Stage 4** Public Alpha · **Stage 5** Onboarding & Review Discipline · **Stage 6** Governance Hardening · **Stage 7** Tooling & Site Layer · **Stage 8** Ecosystem & Labs · **Stage 9**. Steady State & Scale · **∞** dashed extensions.  
Place **ring labels** subtly on the north arc.  Show the **current stage** as a brighter ring.

---

## 6) Rendering plan (phased)

### Phase A — Static SVG (MVP)

- **Generator:** small Python script (`admin/metrics/render_progress_map.py`) that reads `metrics.json` and emits `site/assets/progress_map_v0.svg`.  

- **Design:**  

  - Grid: 8 radials, 10 minor rings per stage with subtle falloff.  

  - Polygon: filled with low-alpha glow; RD voids cut via path subtraction.  

  - Starpoints: small gaussian blur; velocity >0 draws a short motion trail.  

  - Fungal filaments: thin, semi-random bezier curves between linked starpoints.  

- **Color:** monochrome base, automatic accent derived from CI (higher CI → warmer accent).  Accessibility first.  

- **Deliverable:** static asset embedded on CoCivium.org landing page.

### Phase B — Interactive 2D (SVG/D3, React + Tailwind)

- **Controls:** hover tooltips, toggle layers (RD voids, filaments, starpoints), time scrubber across nightly snapshots, export PNG.  

- **Data:** `metrics.json` series in `admin/metrics/history/*.json`.  

- **Tech:** Next.js (or Astro) + D3 for the radar layer.  Keep logic modular.

### Phase C — 3D (Three.js/WebGL)

- **Depth:** rings extruded; starpoints as particles; shooting-star trails animated.  

- **Interaction:** orbit controls, click to open the related file/issue.  

- **Performance:** progressive enhancement (fallback to Phase B on low-end devices).

## 7) Placement & copy on landing page

- **Above the fold:** the canvas/SVG with a short caption:
  
  *“This living map shows CoCoCivium’s real progress across coherence, coverage, onboarding, hygiene, decision integrity, cadence, responsiveness, and community signal.  The brighter the weave, the healthier the organism.”*  

- **Legend:** compact compass legend at bottom-right.  

- **CTA:** “Open issues” and “Contribute” buttons directly under the chart.

## 8) File & folder structure

```
admin/
  metrics/
    build_metrics.yml        # GitHub Action (nightly)
    metrics.json             # latest snapshot
    history/                 # rolling snapshots
    render_progress_map.py   # Phase A generator
assets/
  admin_CoCivium_Progress_Map_Plan_20250810.md
site/
  assets/
    progress_map_v0.svg      # output of Phase A
  components/
    ProgressMap.tsx          # Phase B (future)
```

## 9) Risks & guardrails

- **Vanity risk:** pretty web that hides poor hygiene.  Keep **LSH/OFS/DTI** honest; do not smooth bad scores.  
- **RD denial:** duplication must visibly dent the polygon.  No design override.  
- **Over-theming:** fungal/stellar motif must never reduce legibility.  Contrast and keyboard nav first.

---

## 10) Action checklist (numbered)

1. Create `admin/metrics/build_metrics.yml` (nightly at 02:00 UTC).  

2. Implement metric collectors (CI, Coverage, OFS, LSH, DTI, T, LT, EE, RD).  

3. Emit `metrics.json` and append to `history/` with datestamp.  

4. Write `render_progress_map.py` to generate `site/assets/progress_map_v0.svg`.  

5. Embed the SVG on the landing page with alt text and legend.  

6. Add two demo **starpoints** (MeritRank_Demo, Opename_Stub) wired to real links.  

7. Ship.  Then start Phase B (interactive) on a separate branch.

## 11) Educational notes (optional reading)

- **Why CI ≈ “Godstuff congruence.”** Until we formalize an Ethical Alignment Score, CI (coherence/resonance to the stated vision and recursive ethics) is the least-bad proxy.  The east radial will later multiply CI × EAS.  

- **Why 8 axes.** Human legibility and compass mapping beat maximal completeness.  RD as dents keeps duplication painful without breaking symmetry.
