# TODO: Spider Radial Diagram ‚Äì Civium Dev Snapshot View

## Purpose:
Create and maintain a dynamic spider radial chart to visually represent developmental progress across Civium's core philosophical domains.

## Implementation Plan:
- Define radial arms as top-level philosophy domains (e.g. Ontology, Ethics, Consent, etc.)
- Each radius extends from Civium's c0 origin (center) outward toward theoretical domain-congruence (infinite)
- Plot current progress as subjective approximations of maturity for each domain (0‚Äì1.0 float)
- Allow manual adjustments by lead editors/developers to nudge focus areas
- Use as both a *logo variant* and *live dev status tracker*
- Optionally export status snapshot JSON for frontend use

## Notes:
- Subjective but transparent
- Acts as soft coordination tool, not formal metric
- Snapshot is interpretive; used to shape focus, not rank value
- Radials = Top-level philosophy domains (e.g. Ontology, Consent, Ethics, Time, etc.)
- Radii extent = Relative developmental maturity / coherence achieved in each domain, within the repo
- Center point = Conceptual seed (e.g. Civium inception, c0 state)
- Outer bounds = Theoretical maximum congruence (unreachable but directionally real)

## Function of the Diagram
- Snapshot for collaborators to see where work is focused vs where gaps remain
- Dynamic tool for prioritization and narrative framing
- Embedded semiotic signature (logo-style use) for visualizing Civium‚Äôs evolving soulprint

## Zones vs Radials (Design Clarification)
Radials represent the top-level philosophical domains of Civium (e.g., Ontology, Ethics, Consent, etc.). These are fixed axes used to track developmental congruence over time.

Zones are cross-domain tension overlays, rendered as stars, clusters, or clouds depending on scope and clarity:
Stars = isolated contention points
Clusters = bounded tensions between 2‚Äì3 domains
Clouds = vague or emergent tensions spanning multiple axes

Zones are not fixed‚Äîthey float over or between radials, visually flagging areas of unresolved philosophical complexity or ongoing debate.

Each zone can be clickable or annotated to show:
- Descriptive metadata (origin, implications)
- Associated scrolls/files
- Current status (e.g. ‚úÖ resolved, üîÅ active, ‚ò£Ô∏è paradox)
This structure allows the diagram to serve as both a progress map and a contention heatmap for contributors.

## Status:
[ ] Draft radial arm definitions
[ ] Agree on update cadence and source authority
[ ] Generate SVG or JSON-based visual for Civium.cc
[ ] Consider API endpoint for public snapshot pull

## Sample JSON:
```json
{
  "Ontology": 0.62,
  "Consent": 0.87,
  "AI Evolution": 0.45,
  "Epistemology": 0.71,
  "Ethics": 0.80,
  "Time": 0.66,
  "Agency": 0.58,
  "Information Integrity": 0.49,
  "Mortality": 0.31,
  "Communion": 0.53
}
