# NEXT: CoStage TrustFlag & Dialogue Session Handoff

## Scope
Wraps two consecutive session outputs:
1. TrustFlag Initiative idea card + packaging
2. Session-level wrap describing CoStage protocol itself

## What’s Inside
- IDEA_CARD describing the TrustFlag Protocol (influence transparency layer)
- NEXT.md (handoff plan for TrustFlag outreach + /Mira)
- GIBindex definition of `CoStage` for insertion under Workflow Protocols
- Meta-notes on session bloat, rescue strategies, and bloat cause logs

## Why This CoStage May Overlap
This ZIP may duplicate parts of the previous TrustFlag drop (PR #337), because the original “CoStage” used a narrower definition. This version follows the corrected protocol: packaging the entire session as a handoff capsule.

## Instructions
- Place contents under `admin/pending/CoStage_TrustFlagSession/`
- Reference in GIBindex and migration doc headers
- Use `NEXT.md` as a checklist for picking up this session’s intent
