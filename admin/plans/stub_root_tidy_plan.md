# stub_root_tidy_plan

**Purpose:** propose relocating technical noise from repository root to keep the top of README.md front-and-center for non-technical visitors. **No moves have been made yet.** This is a planning doc.

## Principles
- Preserve all existing links (README, docs, workflows).
- Prefer consolidation under `/admin/` for maintainer-only assets; leave public-facing content at root or `/docs`.
- Add redirects or update links in one sweep when approved.

## Candidates (to review)
- Dotfiles/configs likely to keep at root for tooling (leave in place): `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`
- Tooling configs that could move under `/admin/configs` (if tools support custom paths): `.markdownlint*`, `.mdl*`, `.lychee.toml`, `.yamllint.yml`, `.codespell*`
- Internal scripts: `/merge-pr.sh`, `/ko-finisher.ps1` â†’ maybe `/admin/tools/`
- Histories: already under `/admin/history`
- Anything else flagged by inventory.

## Next steps
1) Approve or strike items above.
2) I will generate a move map and an atomic commit updating all links.
3) Run \  ools/readme-preflight.ps1\ and open PR.
