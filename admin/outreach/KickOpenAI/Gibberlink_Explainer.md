# Gibberlink — 1‑Pager (Plain Language)

**What.** “Gibberlink” is a proposed structured interface for AI‑to‑AI and human‑AI collaboration that emphasizes verifiable claims, typed messages, and reversible transformations.  

**Why here.** It is not part of the escalation ask.  If readers are curious, link this as optional context.  

**Core ideas.**
- Message types with explicit intent (e.g., draft, diff, citation, attestation).  
- Checksums and acceptance tests attached to artifacts.  
- HumanGate checkpoints for public‑facing outputs.  

**Status.** Concept note.  Not required to address today’s product bugs.
