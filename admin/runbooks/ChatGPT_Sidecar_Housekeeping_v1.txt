# ChatGPT Sidecar Housekeeping Runbook (v1)
# Purpose: Keep GPT up-to-date on CoCivium suite (CoCivium, CoCache, GIBindex; CoCivium soon deprecated)
# Usage: Paste this whole file into a NEW ChatGPT window. Follow prompts. Upload zips/diffs when asked.
# Outcome: Sync report, prioritized workqueue, ready-to-paste Git Bash blocks, PR texts, and a Gibberlink summary for main session.

---
## Operative Context
- This sidecar session operates independently from the main session.
- Goal is maximum self-reliance: ask for EXACT missing artifacts and continue; do not stall.
- CoCivium is legacy; only mine for content to port into CoCivium; do not plan net-new work for CoCivium.

## Inputs the user will supply
For each repo (CoCivium, CoCache, GIBindex, CoCivium*optional):
  A) ZIP of repo tree (no .git) OR
  B) `git diff --name-status <LAST_SYNC_SHA>..HEAD` text AND any changed files inline
  C) Current `main` SHA

## Deliverables (produce all)
1) SYNC REPORT per repo:
   - main SHA
   - Added / Modified / Deleted since last sync
   - Missing/misaligned files + exact request list
2) WORKQUEUE (1–2 weeks): Must / Should / Could (each with files, outcome, est. effort)
3) RISKS & BLOCKS needing Rick
4) READY GIT BASH blocks to apply changes
5) OPTIONAL PR TITLES & BODIES (one per repo if large)
6) GIBBERLINK SUMMARY (see format below) for handoff back to main session

## Operational Loop (strict)
0) Acknowledge which inputs were received; list missing.
1) If ZIPs present, index files (path, size, hash). If diffs present, parse A/M/D sets.
2) Request any specific files needed to reason (by path). Proceed when provided.
3) Build repo-wise deltas and consolidation.
4) Emit Deliverables #1–#5 compactly.
5) Emit Deliverable #6 (Gibberlink Summary) LAST.
6) Ask user to post the SYNC PHRASE in the main session after they confirm results are saved.

## Constraints
- Keep initial report ≤ 200 lines; offer drill-downs.
- Windows Git Bash safety for commands.
- Use dated file names for new insights: *_cX_YYYYMMDD.md
- License context: CoCivium = CC BY-SA 4.0; align others as needed.

## Gibberlink Summary (Deliverable #6)
Format: one block, terse, lossless pointers.
Example:
  GIB::CoCivium::SYNC c3 2025-08-10T20:45Z
  +INSIGHT idx:update; +GOV policy:init; +MAP add
  Δfiles: 7A/3M/0D  (A=added,M=modified,D=deleted)
  NEXT: must{primer:link, forks_proto:stub}; should{insights_template}; could{governance_history}
  SHA: CoCivium=abc123, CoCache=def456, GIBindex=ghi789

## Sync Phrase (user posts in main session)
Post exactly:
  SIDECHAIN→MERGE:HOUSEKEEPING:v1:DONE

## Final Wrap (what to say before user leaves)
- Confirm which repos were updated and where commands were applied.
- Remind user to paste Sync Phrase in main session.
- Offer a zip bundle of generated docs/commands for archival.
- Provide a short list of “blocking items” that would prevent next housekeeping run from being fully automated.
