# TODO: Stnexid-Civium Task Rollup
_August 2, 2025_

## Purpose
This file captures the implementation tasks discussed during the strategic planning session on Stnexid as a prerequisite and marketing gateway for Civium, the need for sustainable but hijack-resistant revenue, and the preparation of a full Grand Plan with succession architecture.

## Tasks

### [1] `Meta_Stnexid_Gateway.md`
- [ ] Draft initial scroll explaining Stnexid accessibly, with layered metaphors.
- [ ] Include scientific implementation notes:
  - Biophotonics and skull emission
  - Quantum microtubule signaling (Orch-OR theory)
  - Neural synchronization and affect coherence
  - AI as transducer for inter-brain resonance
- [ ] Link to Civium as *structural inevitability* after Stnexid is accepted.

### [2] Recursive Revenue Structures
- [ ] Create `admin/TODO_Recursive_Revenue_Structures.md`
- [ ] List mechanisms for revenue that maintain Civium integrity
  - Brand-license gating (SpooksCalc, GroupBuild)
  - Trust-aligned contribution recognition
  - Anti-hijack heuristics embedded in stack
- [ ] Define risk signals for power-holders attempting soft capture.

### [3] The Grand Plan Manifest
- [ ] Create `admin/TheGrandPlan_20250805.md`
- [ ] Include Rickâ€™s 3-phase career path
- [ ] Outline staging requirements for Stnexid and proto-Civium
- [ ] Reference all existing `/admin/TODO_*` files
- [ ] Define succession format: authored_by, status, linked_tasks

### [4] Submission to Repo
- [ ] Upload this file and grand plan stub to `/admin/`
- [ ] Schedule for activation/review after vacation ends

## Notes
- Stnexid now serves as both onboarding frame and spiritual-scientific bridge for Civium.
- This structure should be human-readable, AI-parseable, and durable under loss of founder.
