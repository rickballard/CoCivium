# CoCivium Scope Specification (c1)

**Purpose.** Define the boundaries, priorities, and milestones for CoCoCivium’s initial phases.  Serve as both an internal roadmap and a public‑facing invitation for contributors.

**Lineage.** Derived from “CoCivium Scope Specification — Skeleton Draft” (2025‑08‑13).

**Maintainer.** Admin Council (HumanGate) until delegated to CoCivAI Circle.

**Status.** Draft for Review (HumanGate).

**Audience.** Contributors, advisors, and partners across social sciences, policy, and engineering.

**Version.** c1 • 2025-08-13 • CID: TBD

## 1. Vocabulary and Scales

**Theme (Spoke).** A coherent area of work tracked on the scope “right‑eye” spider diagram.  Each theme maps to one or more layers of the classification hierarchy.

**Layer (0..4).**
- **Layer 0 — Charter (normative).** Cognocarta Consenti (CC).  Principles, rights, limits on power.
- **Layer 1 — Operating Constitution (normative).** Org structure, roles, assemblies, budgets, appeals.
- **Layer 2 — Process Specs (normative/technical).** YAML/JSON canonical flows and state machines.
- **Layer 3 — Policies & Standards (informative).** Domain rules, safety playbooks, procurement.
- **Layer 4 — Implementations (informative).** Adapters, identity providers, funding rails, CI, dashboards.

**Readiness Level (RL).** RL0 Concept → RL1 Draft → RL2 V1 → RL3 Iterating → RL4 Mature.  Readiness is recorded per theme×layer pair.

---

## 2. In‑Scope Themes (Spokes)

> Short labels shown in **bold**.  Brackets list principal layers and target readiness this phase.

1. **Principles & Rights** — Layer 0/1 (target RL2).  Consolidate rights, limits, amendment wall.
2. **Decision Frameworks** — Layer 2 (target RL2).  Lifecycle from proposal → deliberation → vote (QV/QF/etc.) → execution.
3. **Ethical AI Integration** — Layer 1/3 (target RL2).  Guardrails, model‑use policy, audit hooks.
4. **Transparency & Oversight** — Layer 1/3 (target RL2).  Records, DRs, public logs, appeals.
5. **Reference Domains** (economy/health/education/justice/security) — Layer 3 (target RL1).  Minimal exemplars, not doctrine.
6. **Identity & Voting** — Layer 2/4 (target RL1).  Pluggable identity, eligibility proofs, coercion‑resistant voting adapters.
7. **Contributor Experience** — Layer 3/4 (target RL3).  Onboarding, templates, CI, docs architecture.
8. **Sustainability & Funding** — Layer 3 (target RL1).  Non‑capture funding rails, disclosure norms.
9. **Tools & Infrastructure** — Layer 4 (target RL2).  GitHub automations, link‑check, pages, observability.
10. **Interoperability & Standards** — Layer 2/3 (target RL1).  Schema registry, export formats, API contracts.

## 3. Out‑of‑Scope (Initial Phases)

1. Partisan or doctrinal policy positions beyond illustrative domain exemplars.
2. Binding endorsements of a single software stack or identity provider.
3. Real‑money treasury mechanics beyond mocks/sandboxes.
4. Production deployment promises to specific jurisdictions.
5. Biometric data collection or any privacy‑sensitive identifiables.

---

## 4. Dependencies and Crosswalk

Create a machine‑readable table (CSV/JSON) that maps **Theme → Layer(s) → Artifacts → Readiness**.  Use the table to auto‑draw the right‑eye diagram and to gate releases.  Example rows:

| Theme | Layers | Key Artifacts | RL |
|---|---|---|---|
| Principles & Rights | 0,1 | CC charter text; amendment wall | RL2 |
| Decision Frameworks | 2 | CPS.yaml; statecharts; test vectors | RL2 |
| Transparency & Oversight | 1,3 | Appeals flow; DR template; logs spec | RL2 |

## 5. Phase Objectives and Triggers

- **Phase 1 — Crown Jewel Delivery.** Public README narrative, CC Charter (L0) at RL2, CPS baseline (L2) at RL2, contributor templates and CI at RL3.  **Exit trigger:** both eyes show ≥60% median spoke readiness.
- **Phase 2 — Sustainability Launch.** Funding rails (mock), governance rituals, growing contributor base.  **Exit trigger:** 3+ adapters live, 1+ pilot.
- **Phase 3 — Systems Integration.** Adapters to Decidim/pol.is/others; schema registry online.
- **Phase 4 — Global Engagement.** Translation cadence, advisory network, pilot reports.

---

## 6. Review and Governance

- Maintainer proposes changes via PR tagged `scope-spec`.  HumanGate approval required.
- Quarterly review cadence.  Each release notes a **Scope Changelog** with rationale and impacts.
- Normative edits to Layers 0–2 require assembly‑level supermajority once constituted.

---

## 7. Marketing and Onboarding Integration

- Surface a 30‑second **Why/Who/How** triad near the README lede.
- Link **Start Here** and the latest release.
- Use scope summaries in outreach posts and contributor issues.

---

## 8. Evolution Clause

This document is **Informative** until ratified.  Normative sections will be explicitly labeled and versioned.  Breaking changes must include a migration note and deprecation window.

### Footer (standardized)

DocType: Informative (pre‑ratification)  •  Layers: 0–4 (see mappings above)  •  Version: c1 (2025-08-13)  •  CohNote: Coherence tag **_c1_**; supersede via **_c2_** with a clear changelog.  Hash: TBD.
