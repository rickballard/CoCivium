# Document Categories

Civium organizes documents into clearly defined types:

| Type      | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Scroll    | Foundational texts, like the Cognocarta Consenti |
| Codex     | Reference materials, rule systems, design frameworks |
| Lexicon   | Definitions of terms and symbols used across the repo |
| Insight   | Essays, speculative thinking, philosophical primers |
| Intent    | Strategic goals, use cases, values in motion |
| Meta      | Repository structure, contribution rules, heuristics |

All categories are recursive: a Lexicon may include Meta notes, a Scroll may define its own Codex entries.

Use `DOC_CATEGORIES.md` to align your contribution with the correct semantic layer.
