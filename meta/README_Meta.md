# Meta Folder

This folder explains how the Civium repository is organized, versioned, and evolved.  
It is intended as the *orientation layer* for both human and artificial contributors.

Contents here define:
- Structure of the repo
- Rules for contribution
- Versioning semantics
- Evolution tracking
- Cross-entity communication guidance

Start here if you're trying to understand how the pieces fit together.
