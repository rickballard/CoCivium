# Trust Without Sovereignty

Civium presumes **no ultimate sovereign**.  
No AI. No state. No institution. No ideology.

Trust arises not from dominance or permanence, but from **alignment and recursion**â€”shared values, revisited often.

We ask minds to trust each other through **transparent iteration**, not control. This is trust without a throne.
