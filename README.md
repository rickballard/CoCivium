> ### A tiny stack of help (human)
> **Eli** is nine and breathing like through a straw. The clinic shuts in 18 minutes.
> The bus board says 3. People on this route know it lies.
> A quick ask. A handful of taps. A ride offers. A tiny fund covers gas.
> Eli gets his treatment in time.
> **What ties this together:** quick ask, few taps, one lift. The taps correct the board.
> Two short receipts become tiny kits others can copy. This is CoCivium.
