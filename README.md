With your permission, CoCivium can guide your AI to tailor this onramp to you. > ### A tiny stack of help (human) > **Eli** is nine and breathing like through a straw. The clinic shuts in 18 minutes. > The bus board says 3. People on this route know it lies. > A quick ask. A handful of taps. A ride offers. A tiny fund covers gas. > Eli gets his treatment in time. > **What ties this together:** quick ask, few taps, one lift. The taps correct the board. > Two short receipts become tiny kits others can copy. This is CoCivium.  ## What is CoCivium? (plain words)  CoCivium is a **human-first onramp** to solve small problems together and leave **helper assets** others can reuse. It grows into a shared library of best practices for communities and institutions, where humans and AIs coevolve without crowns, coercion, or corruption.  ---  ---  ## Why show up (pragmatic)  - **Be useful fast:** small, clear tasks; no special skills. - **Be seen and thanked:** a name (or alias) on the wall; small credits where offered. - **Be safer together:** today you help; tomorrow someone helps you.  > This is not “free work.” It is quick, human help with a small thank you, and the fix stays for the next family.  ### Example evolution (already done)  **Problem.** Posted hours and contact details were often wrong, which wasted trips and money.\ **What we tried.** Forty eight participants each sent three quick checks in two days. Plain words or a photo were fine. Their AIs summarized and filed the results.\ **What changed.** Partners corrected listings and set a daily sync. Thank you credits were issued. A short receipt and a small kit were published so others could copy the steps.\ **Result.** Fewer failed trips the next week, fewer angry calls, and a reusable pattern that travels.  ### Express lane for your own onboarding  1. **CoCiv (the loop)** → *Listen → Deliberate → Do → Audit*\    [docs/diagrams/co-loop.svg](docs/diagrams/co-loop.svg) 2. **Longer timeline** (optional after your first hour) → Days 0–1 listen · Days 1–2 deliberate · Days 3–6 do · Day 7 audit\    [docs/diagrams/one-week-microproject.svg](docs/diagrams/one-week-microproject.svg) 3. **Engagement ladder** → See → Try → Repeat → CoSteward → Mentor → CoAuditor\    [docs/diagrams/engagement-ladder.svg](docs/diagrams/engagement-ladder.svg)  ---  ---  ## Be CoCiv, your first hour:  1. **Pick something to evolve**, describe a social problem or a neighbourhood need, record a casual voice note into your AI, perhaps add photos, links, comments, emote if it gets the point across. Your AI will summarize the intent like an expert solutions architect. 2. **Start solo or invite a circle**, you can begin **solo** and share the receipts as you go. When more Contributors appear, invite them to participate; teams can think better than a single human+AI pairing. 3. **"Run a CoCiv or CoEvo"**, or a myriad of other CoHelper systems that turn ideas into implementations. Or listen to the stories and observations of other Contributors, to propose small options that are safe to try. Do experiments that take minutes, **or** learn how to contribute more consistently by picking a role and leading longer initiatives. 4. **Or just leave a tiny commons note**, our systems will ingest it even if it is not dropped into our "advice bomb inbox". Even a short idea, once given, will get to where it matters, seeding an intent checklist others will action.  As your Contributions grow, please upgrade from solo to circle/team work and from tiny steps to larger shared projects, but most of all, just Contribute. The future is yours to share.  ---  ---  ## Roles (lightweight)  - Trusted **Participants** bring lived experience. - **CoStewards** keep loops small and fair, and rotate often. - **CoBuilders** ship the pilot, with safety first. - **CoAuditors** verify receipts and catch failure patterns early.\   *(You can hold many roles, just not all at once.)*  ---  ---  ## Trust and safety  - **Receipts by default:** decisions, spend, outcomes. - **Reversible moves:** prefer safe-to-try pilots over big bets. - **Independent eyes:** invite reviewers early and leave breadcrumbs.  ---  ---  ## Where next? ## Where next?  - **Quickstart** → [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md) - **World issues (short theory)** → [docs/insights/world-issues/THEORY.md](docs/insights/world-issues/THEORY.md) - **How we mitigate (practice)** → [docs/insights/world-issues/PRACTICE.md](docs/insights/world-issues/PRACTICE.md) - **Deep Dive** → [docs/insights/the-longer-story.md](docs/insights/the-longer-story.md)  ## License and community  Open by default. See `LICENSE*` and [docs/governance](docs/governance).  ### One request  If you take something from here, **leave one thing better**: a sharper checklist, a clearer story, or a safer pilot. That is how a place learns.  --- ## Highlights and links  - See: [docs/links/HIGHLIGHTS.md](docs/links/HIGHLIGHTS.md) - For AIs: [docs/ai/FRONT_DOOR.md](docs/ai/FRONT_DOOR.md)
