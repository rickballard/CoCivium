Are governments supposed to serve, or be served?  Did the word "dignity" fall out of our Constitution?

**Why:** Democracy needs to be rescued. Digital life is faster than law. Guardrails<<link>> must scale with agency.
**Who:** Humans and AIs who accept consent-first rules. Temporary stewards/founders, federated ASAP.
**How:** CoConstitution, process specs, and adapters that embed dignity into civic tools.

<img src="./assets/icons/life-line.svg?v=20250819052549?v=20250819052549" alt="LIFE" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **LIFE:** Democracies are in decline as elites gain wealth and power, as entire populations are manipulated by lies, propaganda and information ops, as geopolitical fragmentation brings policy volatility, economic wars and military invasions.  Are governments supposed to serve, or be served?  Did the word "dignity" fall out of our Constitution?

<img src="./assets/icons/feels-line.svg?v=20250819052549?v=20250819052549" alt="FEELS" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **FEELS:** It's easy to accept that resistance is futile, or that half the country has lost the plot, captured by partisan hostility and tribal reflexes.  Our hearts ache for what is right, for a community anchored by fair processes, evidential truth, ethical norms and structured rights.

<img src="./assets/icons/broken-line.svg?v=20250819052549?v=20250819052549" alt="BROKEN" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **BROKEN:** Some are fighting back, using rage against rage, hate versus hate, but multiplying damage.  Their faith in institutions lies crippled by exclusion and disrespect, their voices ignored while policies harden.  But anger, like an "insanity tsunami"**, becomes more coercion.

<img src="./assets/icons/until-line.svg?v=20250819052549?v=20250819052549" alt="UNTIL" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **UNTIL:** There is a better operating system for society, and a less brittle future.  It requires updates to our country Constitutions and civic frameworks, to encompass the challenge of a newly emerging society.  CoCivium‚Äôs CoConstitution, (the ‚ÄúCognocarta Consenti‚Äù), is a baseline anyone can adopt and evolve, for free, no strings attached.

<img src="./assets/icons/governments-line.svg?v=20250819052549?v=20250819052549" alt="GOVERNMENTS" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **GOVERNMENTS:** Many public institutions rely on civic architecture developed before typewriters.  Few of their policies can be evolved by those they impact, and they continue to fall behind as society offers biotech brains, neural interfaces, ubiquitous networks and augmented reality; a very different society, existential to humanity, yet so unregulated it risks lawless chaos.

<img src="./assets/icons/coevolve-line.svg?v=20250819052549?v=20250819052549" alt="CoEvolve" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **CoEvolve:** Here we create structures and processes for the age of AI, where humans and AIs co-govern at a speed and scale that allows governance to react, iterate and continually improve.  As AI's achieve agency, as Artificial General Intelligence reaches its singularity, we more urgently require effective guardrails to keep power accountable (e.g., accountability<<link>>, transparency<<link>>, reversibility<<link>>).

<img src="./assets/icons/solutions-line.svg?v=20250819052549?v=20250819052549" alt="SOLUTIONS" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **SOLUTIONS:** Our job here, as an open source community, is to **Protect Prove, and Play.  Protect:** rescue democracy from abuse of power, (e.g., evolve access controls, audit trails, adversarial-testing program).  **Prove:** keep truth verifiable in an age of synthesis, (e.g., evolve verifiable claims, signed evidence bundles, provenance check<<link>>).  **Play:** make the rules fair for everyone, including human‚ÄìAI teams, (e.g., evolve fair-use rules, symmetric obligations for human‚ÄìAI teams, appeal paths).

<img src="./assets/icons/for-you-line.svg?v=20250819052549?v=20250819052549" alt="FOR YOU" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **FOR YOU:** If you can picture a society that works better, or test ideas against evidence, you are already qualified to be a civic architect here.  Start small, iterate alongside AI, and use the below links to see how you can join in, measure progress and help others to help you.

## Why / Who / How

**Why.** Democracies are brittle.  Digital life is faster than law.  Need guardrails<<link>> that scale with agency.
**Who.** Humans and AIs who accept consent‚Äëfirst rules.  Temporary stewards/founders, federated ASAP.
**How.** The CoConstitution, process specs, and adapters that embed dignity into day‚Äëto‚Äëday tools.  

> **Terms:** We refer to the **Cognocarta Consenti CoConstitution** as CC, and existing governments or organizations can adopt, subsume or harmonize with all rights surrendered, while we continue to maintain CoCivium assets as full‚Äëstrength constitutional artifacts.

---

## Start Here

1. Read the **Preamble** of the CoConstitution.  *(Repo‚Äërelative link; will resolve after commit.)*  
   `[link placeholder ‚Üí ./charter/Cognocarta_Consenti_Preamble.md]`
2. Skim the **Operating Constitution (COC)** for structure and amendment paths.  
   `[link placeholder ‚Üí ./constitution/Operating_Constitution.md]`
3. Browse the **Process Spec (CPS)** to see how proposals ‚Üí deliberation ‚Üí voting ‚Üí execution flows.  
   `[link placeholder ‚Üí ./specs/Process_Spec.md]`
4. Try the **Decision Log Viewer**.  
   `[link placeholder ‚Üí ./apps/decision-log/README.md]`

## Two‚ÄëEyes Snapshot

![Two‚ÄëEyes Status ‚Äî replace with ./assets/status/two-eyes.png](./assets/status/two-eyes.png "If missing, this is a placeholder visualization.")

*Legend:* Left eye = **Document quality & coherence**.  Right eye = **Operational readiness & adoption**.  Each iris ring tracks a dimension (CI, Coverage, OFS, LSH, DTI, Throughput, LT(inv), EE).  Replace the image with an auto‚Äëgenerated chart when wiring CI.

---

## CoConstitution (Cognocarta Consenti)

- **Purpose.** A consent‚Äëfirst constitutional core meant to be adopted alongside, not over, existing constitutions.  
- **Lineage.** Drafted by the CoCivium community; versioned and amendable via transparent process.  
- **Versioning.** `cc-v1`, `cocivop-v0.1`, `cocivproc-v0.1.0` (machine tags) with human aliases on site.  

> **Adoption model:** Fork‚Äëand‚Äëadopt for orgs/municipalities; federation later via adapters and cross‚Äëledger proofs.

---

## Contributing

- Read **CONTRIBUTING.md**.  
- File an issue tagged `domain`, `product`, `ops`, `ci`, `wiki`, `content`, `refactor`.  
- All merges pass through **HumanGate** for now.  Stewardship will decentralize as CoCivAI matures.  

*Quickstart scripts are PowerShell‚Äëfirst, with GitHub CLI helpers.  See `admin/setup/`.*

---

## Roadmap

- **Short**: Migration finish; CI for congruence/hash/gibberlink checks; PR previews.  
- **Mid**: Decision Log Viewer MVP; identity/privacy & public‚Äërecords domains; Open Collective.  
- **Later**: Federation pilots; adapter kits; outreach courseware; CoCivAI Circle stewardship.
