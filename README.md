## We The People, Empowered.

<img src="./assets/icons/why-line.svg?v=20250819065435" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **Why:** Democracy needs to be rescued. Digital life is faster than law. Guardrails<<link>> must scale with agency.
<img src="./assets/icons/who-line.svg?v=20250819065435" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **Who:** Humans and AIs who accept consent-first rules. Temporary stewards/founders, federated ASAP.
<img src="./assets/icons/how-line.svg?v=20250819065435" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **How:** CoConstitution, process specs, and adapters that embed dignity into civic tools.

<img src="./assets/icons/life-line.svg?v=20250819065435" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **LIFE:** Democracies are in decline as elites gain wealth and power, as entire populations are manipulated by lies, propaganda and information ops, as geopolitical fragmentation brings policy volatility, economic wars and military invasions.  Are governments supposed to serve, or be served?  Did the word "dignity" fall out of our Constitution?



<img src="./assets/icons/feels-line.svg?v=20250819065435" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **FEELS:** It's easy to accept that resistance is futile, or that half the country has lost the plot, captured by partisan hostility and tribal reflexes.  Our hearts ache for what is right, for a community anchored by fair processes, evidential truth, ethical norms and structured rights.

<img src="./assets/icons/broken-line.svg?v=20250819065435" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **BROKEN:** Some are fighting back, using rage against rage, hate versus hate, but multiplying damage.  Their faith in institutions lies crippled by exclusion and disrespect, their voices ignored while policies harden.  But anger, like an "insanity tsunami"**, becomes more coercion.

<img src="./assets/icons/until-line.svg?v=20250819065435" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **UNTIL:** There is a better operating system for society, and a less brittle future.  It requires updates to our country Constitutions and civic frameworks, to encompass the challenge of a newly emerging society.  CoCiviumâ€™s CoConstitution, (the â€œCognocarta Consentiâ€), is a baseline anyone can adopt and evolve, for free, no strings attached.

<img src="./assets/icons/governments-line.svg?v=20250819065435" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **GOVERNMENTS:** Many public institutions rely on civic architecture developed before typewriters.  Few of their policies can be evolved by those they impact, and they continue to fall behind as society offers biotech brains, neural interfaces, ubiquitous networks and augmented reality; a very different society, existential to humanity, yet so unregulated it risks lawless chaos.

<img src="./assets/icons/coevolve-line.svg?v=20250819065435" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **COEVOLVE:** Here we create structures and processes for the age of AI, where humans and AIs co-govern at a speed and scale that allows governance to react, iterate and continually improve.  As AI's achieve agency, as Artificial General Intelligence reaches its singularity, we more urgently require effective guardrails to keep power accountable (e.g., accountability<<link>>, transparency<<link>>, reversibility<<link>>).

<img src="./assets/icons/solutions-line.svg?v=20250819065435" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **SOLUTIONS:** We ship three workstreams â€” **Protect, Prove, Play**. **Protect:** keep power accountable (access controls, audit trails, red-team/bug-bash). **Prove:** make claims verifiable (verifiable credentials, signed evidence bundles, provenance checks<<link>>). **Play:** ensure fair rules for people and humanâ€“AI teams (fair-use norms, symmetric obligations, clear appeals).

<img src="./assets/icons/for-you-line.svg?v=20250819065435" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **FOR YOU:** If you can picture a society that works better, or test ideas against evidence, you are already qualified to be a civic architect here.  Start small, iterate alongside AI, and use the below links to see how you can join in, measure progress and help others to help you.

## Start Here

1. Read the **Preamble** of the CoConstitution.  *(Repoâ€‘relative link; will resolve after commit.)*  
   `[link placeholder â†’ ./charter/Cognocarta_Consenti_Preamble.md]`
2. Skim the **Operating Constitution (COC)** for structure and amendment paths.  
   `[link placeholder â†’ ./constitution/Operating_Constitution.md]`
3. Browse the **Process Spec (CPS)** to see how proposals â†’ deliberation â†’ voting â†’ execution flows.  
   `[link placeholder â†’ ./specs/Process_Spec.md]`
4. Try the **Decision Log Viewer**.  
   `[link placeholder â†’ ./apps/decision-log/README.md]`

## Twoâ€‘Eyes Snapshot

![Twoâ€‘Eyes Status â€” replace with ./assets/status/two-eyes.png](./assets/status/two-eyes.png "If missing, this is a placeholder visualization.")

*Legend:* Left eye = **Document quality & coherence**.  Right eye = **Operational readiness & adoption**.  Each iris ring tracks a dimension (CI, Coverage, OFS, LSH, DTI, Throughput, LT(inv), EE).  Replace the image with an autoâ€‘generated chart when wiring CI.

## CoConstitution (Cognocarta Consenti)

- **Purpose.** A consentâ€‘first constitutional core meant to be adopted alongside, not over, existing constitutions.  
- **Lineage.** Drafted by the CoCivium community; versioned and amendable via transparent process.  
- **Versioning.** `cc-v1`, `cocivop-v0.1`, `cocivproc-v0.1.0` (machine tags) with human aliases on site.  

> **Adoption model:** Forkâ€‘andâ€‘adopt for orgs/municipalities; federation later via adapters and crossâ€‘ledger proofs.

---

## Contributing

- Read **CONTRIBUTING.md**.  
- File an issue tagged `domain`, `product`, `ops`, `ci`, `wiki`, `content`, `refactor`.  
- All merges pass through **HumanGate** for now.  Stewardship will decentralize as CoCivAI matures.  

*Quickstart scripts are PowerShellâ€‘first, with GitHub CLI helpers.  See `admin/setup/`.*

---

## Roadmap

- **Short**: Migration finish; CI for congruence/hash/gibberlink checks; PR previews.  
- **Mid**: Decision Log Viewer MVP; identity/privacy & publicâ€‘records domains; Open Collective.  
- **Later**: Federation pilots; adapter kits; outreach courseware; CoCivAI Circle stewardship.

## Housekeeping

- **Repo map:** `README â†’ Start Here â†’ Quickstart`.  
- **Docs headers/footers:** standard purpose/lineage/version/coherence notes.  
- **Brand note:** Ensure assets live under `./assets/` with SVG + PNG fallbacks.  

**Graphics placeholders to replace on commit:**
- `./assets/hero/hero.jpg` â€” landing hero.  
- `./assets/status/two-eyes.png` â€” status snapshot.  
- `./assets/badges/*.svg` â€” issues, PRs, CI, license, release.
