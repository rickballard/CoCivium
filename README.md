### Why Â· Who Â· How (30 sec)

**Why.** Build a durable, rights-first operating constitution and process stack for AIâ€“human governance that resists capture.  

**Who.** Social scientists, civic technologists, policy folks, and engineers collaborating under HumanGate until assemblies form.  

**How.** Start from the [Scope Specification](admin/projects/CoCivium_Scope_Specification_c1_20250813.md), track progress via the Twin Eyes, and contribute through issues/PRs using our standard templates.  
<!-- /triad:why-who-how -->
Democracy protocols and civic-tech tools for borderless governance.

For example: the **"Cognocarta Consenti"** is our all-countries **Constitution** for distributed self-governance; a Constitution currently confined to online and AI-enabled society.  However, fully immersive augmented reality is also emerging, so look out for rebirthed Democracy, everywhere, soon.

## The Opportunity

"We The People" continually re-invent ourselves and our societies.
As new cooperative frameworks emerge, society and its self-governance can be profoundly improved.
Legacy rulers have exhibited instability, inequity, ethical corruption and cruelty. 
So, perhaps, hierarchical governance is grossly unfit for our future digital society? 
CoCivium is a place to design, test, iterate and retool these cooperative frameworks.
Society need not be cooercive, social guidance can be open, audible, and forkâ€‘friendly.
Thus, continually improving selfâ€‘governance emerges through "We The People, Empowered".

## What is CoCivium?

CoCivium is an onlineâ€‘first **cooperation environment** where intelligent beings coâ€‘evolve governance frameworks and shared
civic infrastructure. The aim is **emergent ethical congruence**: enabling decisions that increase wholeâ€‘system coherence and sustainable
equity. Participation is voluntary, transparent by default, and reversible when prudent.

## Core Principles

**0)** **Prime Directive â€” Congruence (recursive ethics).** Actions should increase wholeâ€‘system coherence, and the rule applies to itself.  

**1)** **Consent over coercion.** Optâ€‘in, informed, granular, revocable.  

**2)** **Accountability with trails.** Clear owners, appeals, restitution, public rationale.  

**3)** **Transparency by default; privacy by right.** Open process/code; userâ€‘owned keys; portability; erasure.  

**4)** **Evidence over authority.** Claims need sources, tests, and adversarial review.  

**5)** **Least power, staged risk.** Minimal permissions; sandboxes; killâ€‘switches; reversibleâ€‘first.  

**6)** **Fairness and proportionality.** Rights floors; meritâ€‘weighted influence; proportional sanctions.  

**7)** **Pluralism and interoperability.** Many worldviews; shared protocols; easy forkâ€‘andâ€‘rejoin.  

**8)** **Resilience via redundancy.** No single point of failureâ€”technical, social, or legal.  

**9)** **Commons stewardship.** Open licenses; contributor covenant; antiâ€‘enclosure.  

**10)** **Incentive alignment.** Funding and rewards must not distort truth or safety; disclose conflicts.  

**11)** **Antitrust of power (human or AI).** Caps on governance share; rotation; independence tests.  

**12)** **Continuous improvement.** Versioned experiments; metrics, rollbacks, upgrade paths.  

**13)** **Nonâ€‘violence and dignified discourse.** Mediation over flame wars; restorative outcomes.  

**14)** **Sustainability and longâ€‘termism.** Price externalities; favor multiâ€‘generational impact.  

**15)** **Inclusivity and accessibility (all minds).** Real access for human and synthetic minds; strong onâ€‘ramps.

### Support CoCivium (temporary)

Until our Open Collective is live, the **Sponsor** button links to  
[DogsnHomes](https://dogsnhomes.org.uk/support-us/) â€” a *family charity*.  
> **Important:** Donations made there **support DogsnHomesâ€™ mission** and **do not fund CoCivium operations**.  
Open Collective is coming soon for transparent, **no-strings-attached** CoCivium support.
