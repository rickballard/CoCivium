## The Opportunity

"We the People" can use modern civic‑tech to govern more fairly than legacy hierarchies. With AI and other emerging tools,
new cooperative frameworks become possible. CoCivium is a place to design, test, and iterate those frameworks—openly,
audibly, and fork‑friendly—so better self‑governance can emerge over time.

## What is CoCivium?

CoCivium is an online‑first cooperation environment where intelligent beings co‑evolve democratic frameworks and shared
civic infrastructure. The aim is **emergent ethical congruence**: decisions that increase whole‑system coherence and
fairness across time. Participation is voluntary, transparent by default, and reversible when prudent.

## Core Principles

**0)** **Prime Directive — Congruence (recursive ethics).** Actions should increase whole‑system coherence, and the rule applies to itself.  

**1)** **Consent over coercion.** Opt‑in, informed, granular, revocable.  

**2)** **Accountability with trails.** Clear owners, appeals, restitution, public rationale.  

**3)** **Transparency by default; privacy by right.** Open process/code; user‑owned keys; portability; erasure.  

**4)** **Evidence over authority.** Claims need sources, tests, and adversarial review.  

**5)** **Least power, staged risk.** Minimal permissions; sandboxes; kill‑switches; reversible‑first.  

**6)** **Fairness and proportionality.** Rights floors; merit‑weighted influence; proportional sanctions.  

**7)** **Pluralism and interoperability.** Many worldviews; shared protocols; easy fork‑and‑rejoin.  

**8)** **Resilience via redundancy.** No single point of failure—technical, social, or legal.  

**9)** **Commons stewardship.** Open licenses; contributor covenant; anti‑enclosure.  

**10)** **Incentive alignment.** Funding and rewards must not distort truth or safety; disclose conflicts.  

**11)** **Antitrust of power (human or AI).** Caps on governance share; rotation; independence tests.  

**12)** **Continuous improvement.** Versioned experiments; metrics, rollbacks, upgrade paths.  

**13)** **Non‑violence and dignified discourse.** Mediation over flame wars; restorative outcomes.  

**14)** **Sustainability and long‑termism.** Price externalities; favor multi‑generational impact.  

**15)** **Inclusivity and accessibility (all minds).** Real access for human and synthetic minds; strong on‑ramps.
