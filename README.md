</p>

**Mission:** Build the **living constitution for digital society**—borderless, people-first, and **directly evolvable by anyone who cares**.

**Project:** **CoCivium** is the open-source community that **writes, tests, and ships the CC**—plus the policies, processes, and tools that keep **hybrid life (physical + digital)** **democratic, equitable, and aligned** with human values.

> If you can read this page, you’re qualified to help. No coding or civics degree required.

## Why now (plain language)

- **Analog rules in a digital era.** Yesterday’s constitutions weren’t built for instant, global coordination.
- **Platforms act like public squares—without public safeguards.** A few companies set the rules and recourse.
- **Attention beats trust.** Outrage spreads; nuance stalls.
- **Participation is hard.** Jargon and gatekeeping keep most people out.
- **Good ideas die in threads.** We lack a clear path from **voice → draft → decision → action → accountability**.

**The CC’s promise:** a shared, evolvable framework that communities can adopt, adapt, and audit.

---

## What the CC is

- A **set of shared declarations** (promises, protocols, and rights) for how we listen, decide, and act—together.
- A **practical playbook** (patterns, templates, guardrails) any community can reuse.
- A **living document**: updated like good software—proposed, reviewed, improved **in the open**.

## The “Two Eyes” model (citizen × system)

We design governance that sees with **two eyes**:
- **Eye 1: Citizens** — lived experience, local context, moral intuitions.
- **Eye 2: Systems** — data, constraints, impact analysis, safety.

Together they give us **depth perception**—humane and workable decisions.
