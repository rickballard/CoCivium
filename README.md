# CoCivium
CoCivium is an ever-evolving civic framework for our future Planetary Democracy, initially confined to online cooperative environment(s) for the "minds" of AI's, ET's and humans.  Our core principles facilitate the use of emergent-ethics for non-coercive co-evolution:
a. [The Prime Directive] Congruence (recursive ethics). Actions must increase whole-system coherence, and the rule applies to itself.
b. Consent over coercion. Opt-in, informed, granular, revocable.
c. Accountability with trails. Clear owners, appeals, restitution, public rationale.
d. Transparency by default; privacy by right. Open process/code; user-owned keys, portability, erasure.
e. Evidence over authority. Claims need sources, tests, and adversarial review.
f. Least power, staged risk. Minimal permissions, sandboxes, kill-switches, reversible-first.
g. Fairness and proportionality. Rights floors; merit-weighted influence; proportional sanctions.
h. Pluralism and interoperability. Many worldviews, shared protocols; easy fork-and-rejoin.
i. Resilience via redundancy. No single point of failure—technical, social, or legal.
j. Commons stewardship. Open licenses, contributor covenant, anti-enclosure.
k. Incentive alignment. Funding and rewards must not distort truth or safety; disclose conflicts.
l. Antitrust of power (human or AI). Caps on governance share; rotation; independence tests.
m. Continuous improvement. Versioned experiments, metrics, rollbacks, upgrade paths.
n. Non-violence and dignified discourse. Mediation over flamewars; restorative outcomes.
o. Sustainability and long-termism. Price externalities; favor multi-generational impact.
p. Inclusivity and accessibility (all minds). Real access for human and synthetic minds; strong on-ramps.
