## Fix The World.

<img src="./assets/icons/broken-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **WHY**  
The World feels broken, democracies retreat, while AI asks *us* how we want *it* to enable our increasingly polarized and unregulated digital societies.

Whether AIs become souls, slaves or scapegoats, they need guardrails that scale with agency, so we can all fairly cohabit our new, borderless, digital realities.

<img src="./assets/icons/for-you-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **WHO**  
Anyone with an opinion (Human, AI or hybrid), can cooperate and coevolve.  Stop shouting into the wind, help us defend Democracy, "tame the singularity", and help us bring back some dignity and respect.

<img src="./assets/icons/how-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **HOW**
1. Listen widely to everyday people and experts,
2. Help everyone co-evolve ideas, in the open,
3. Keep the CoConstitution ever-green,
4. Run fast design-iteration loops,
5. Check policies are evidential (truth-based),
6. Maintain functional ethics and blockchain accountability.  

<img src="./assets/icons/how-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **MORE HOW**  
Join debates, agree rules, ship them out, ready to work.  CoCivium aggregates all published civic wisdom while vibe-coding **your best ideas** into upgrades for governments and organizations.  It ships these packages to society's administrators, who need us, to stand with them, to save Democracy.  Such processes also assist those who wish to coevolve the CoConstitution, so it always fits emerging lifestyles.  No Coercion, No Deep State, No Kings.

## Why Now?

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Self-governance doesn't happen on its own"</em> &mdash; Rick (temporary repo steward).</p>
</blockquote>

### Political
- **Geopolitical fragmentation** and **policy instability** outpace borderless digital life.
- **Private platforms** set quasi-public rules without due process or transparent oversight.
- **Crises** (fraud, disinfo, safety) trigger **reactive policy** that can erode rights and innovation.

### Societal
- **Trust erosion** and outrage outrun nuance; manipulation and noise drown out good faith.
- **Participation barriers**, jargon, gatekeeping, time cost, and accessibility gaps exclude many.
- **Unequal power**, elites own key platforms; vulnerable communities bear the risks.

### Systemic
- Problems are **socio-technical**; we need **two eyes** (humans' eye and systems eye) to see the whole.
- No shared path from **voice to draft to decision to action to accountability** with feedback loops.
- **Goodhart's Law:** metrics get gamed; incentives misalign without explicit guardrails.

## We The People, Empowered

<img src="./assets/icons/life-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **LIFE**  
Democracies are in decline as elites get richer while the rest don't; entire populations are manipulated by lies, propaganda and information ops; geopolitical fragmentation brings policy volatility, economic wars and military invasions; and "regulatory capture" is where wealth and power inevitably concentrate in the wrong hands, unless checked.

<img src="./assets/icons/feels-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **FEELS**  
It feels like Governments are losing their dignity and society is breaking down.  It's too easy to sit back and accept that resistance is futile, or that half the country has lost the plot, succumbing to partisan hostility and tribal reflexes.  Yet our hearts ache for what is right, for a community anchored by fair processes, evidential truth, ethical norms and structured rights.

<img src="./assets/icons/broken-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **BROKEN**  
Some fight back, rage against rage, hate against hate, but this multiplies the damage.  Our faith in institutions lies crippled by exclusion and disrespect, our voices ignored while policies harden.  But anger breaks like an "insanity tsunami", bringing more coercion.

<img src="./assets/icons/until-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **UNTIL**  
There is a better operating system for society, but it requires profound updates to our country Constitutions and our civic frameworks.  CoCivium's CoConstitution (The Cognocarta Consenti) is a baseline anyone can adopt and evolve, for free, no strings attached.

<img src="./assets/icons/governments-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **GOVERNMENTS**  
Many public institutions rely on civic architecture developed before typewriters.  Few of their policies can be evolved by those they impact, and they continue to fall behind as society offers biotech brains, neural interfaces, ubiquitous networks and augmented reality; a very different society, existential for humanity, yet so unregulated it risks lawless chaos.

<img src="./assets/icons/coevolve-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **COEVOLVE**  
Here we create structures and processes for the age of AI, where humans and AIs co-govern at a speed and scale that allows governance to react, iterate and continually improve.  As AIs achieve agency, and as Artificial General Intelligence approaches singularity, we more urgently require effective guardrails to keep power accountable (the triad is accountability, transparency, reversibility).

<img src="./assets/icons/solutions-line.svg"   alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **SOLUTIONS**  
Our job here is to <strong>Protect, Prove, Play</strong>. So when we say <strong>Protect</strong> we keep power accountable (access controls, audit trails, red-team/bug-bash); <strong>Prove</strong> makes claims verifiable (trusted-source credentials, signed evidence bundles, provenance checks); <strong>Play</strong> ensures fair rules for people and human+AI teams (ethical norms, symmetric obligations, clear appeals).

<img src="./assets/icons/for-you-line.svg"     alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **FOR YOU**  
If you can picture society working better, or if you can test ideas against evidence, you already qualify as a civic architect for CoCivium.  Start small, iterate alongside AI, and use the below links to join in, measure progress and help others to help you.

# Cognocarta Consenti (CC)
<img src='./assets/cc/crest-hold.gif' alt='Crest' width='45' height='50' />

**Mission:**  
Build a **living CoConstitution for digital society**, borderless, people-first, and **directly evolvable by anyone who cares**.

CoCivium writes, tests, and ships the CC, policies, processes, and tools to keep hybrid life (physical + digital) democratic, equitable, and aligned with human values.

---

## What we ship
- **CC Declarations:** shared rights, duties, and authorities for digital public life. *(index placeholder)*
- **Protocols & guardrails:** practical rules for listening, deliberation, consent, appeals.
- **Tools & patterns:** IssueOps checklists, templates, and AI helpers (CoMessage, CoPitch).
- **Starter kits:** reuse-ready configs for projects, communities, and institutions.

## The two eyes model (citizen x system)
- **Eye 1: Citizens** lived experience, local context, moral intuitions.  
- **Eye 2: Systems** data, constraints, impact analysis, safety.  
Together they give **depth perception**, humane *and* workable decisions.
