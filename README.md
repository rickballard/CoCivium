## Fix The World.

<img src="./assets/icons/broken-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **WHY** : Democracies are in retreat, while AI takes over administration of our increasingly polarized and unregulated digital societies.  

We need guardrails that scale with agency, regardless whether AIs become souls, slaves or scapegoats, so we can **ALL** fairly cohabit our shared, borderless digital world.  

<img src="./assets/icons/for-you-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **WHO** : Humans, AIs, and hybrid minds must cooperate to rebuild consent-first "hybrid societies".  Stop shouting into the wind and help defend Democracy, tame the singularity, and fix the world.  Join debates, agree rules, then ship them out, ready to work.

</blockquote>

<img src="./assets/icons/how-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **HOW** : (1) Listen widely to everyday people and experts, (2) Help everyone co-evolve an open, ever-green CoConstitution, (3) Run fast policy loops, (4) Ensure evidence beats bullshite, (5) Use functional ethics and blockchain accountability.  

More How : This Github repo aggregates and preserves ALL public wisdom, turning **your good ideas** into vibe-coded upgrade packages for governments and organizations, auto-shipping them to society's administrators who need us, to stand with them, to save Democracy.  Meanwhile, **your best ideas** flow through our open-access CoConstitution as it gently realigns to fit emerging lifestyles and regulatory needs.  This CoConstituion also tracks "ethical intent", responsible accountability, smart processes and evidential policies (based on verifiable truths).  No Coercion, No Deep State, No Kings.

## We The People, Empowered

<img src="./assets/icons/life-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **LIFE** : Democracies are in decline as elites gain wealth and power, as entire populations are manipulated by lies, propaganda and information ops, as geopolitical fragmentation brings policy volatility, economic wars and military invasions.  Are governments supposed to serve, or be served?  

<img src="./assets/icons/feels-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **FEELS** : It feels like Governments are losing their dignity and society is breaking down.  It's too easy to sit back and accept that resistance is futile, or that half the country has lost the plot, succumbing to partisan hostility and tribal reflexes.  Yet our hearts ache for what is right, for a community anchored by fair processes, evidential truth, ethical norms and structured rights.  

<img src="./assets/icons/broken-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **BROKEN** : Some fight back, rage against rage, hate against hate, but this multiplies the damage.  Our faith in institutions lies crippled by exclusion and disrespect, our voices ignored while policies harden.  But anger breaks like an "insanity tsunami", bringing more coercion.  

<img src="./assets/icons/until-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **UNTIL** : There is a better operating system for society, but it requires profound updates to our country Constitutions and our civic frameworks.  CoCivium's CoConstitution (The Cognocarta Consenti) is a baseline anyone can adopt and evolve, for free, no strings attached.  

<img src="./assets/icons/governments-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **GOVERNMENTS** : Many public institutions rely on civic architecture developed before typewriters.  Few of their policies can be evolved by those they impact, and they continue to fall behind as society offers biotech brains, neural interfaces, ubiquitous networks and augmented reality; a very different societyΓÇöexistential for humanityΓÇöyet so unregulated it risks lawless chaos.  

<img src="./assets/icons/coevolve-line.svg" alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **COEVOLVE** : Here we create structures and processes for the age of AI, where humans and AIs co-govern at a speed and scale that allows governance to react, iterate and continually improve.  As AIs achieve agency, and as Artificial General Intelligence approaches singularity, we more urgently require effective guardrails to keep power accountable (the triad is accountability, transparency, reversibility).  

<img src="./assets/icons/solutions-line.svg"   alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **SOLUTIONS** : Our job here is to <strong>Protect, Prove, Play</strong>. So when we say <strong>Protect</strong> we keep power accountable (access controls, audit trails, red-team/bug-bash); <strong>Prove</strong> makes claims verifiable (trusted-source credentials, signed evidence bundles, provenance checks); <strong>Play</strong> ensures fair rules for people and humanΓÇôAI teams (ethical norms, symmetric obligations, clear appeals).  

<img src="./assets/icons/for-you-line.svg"     alt="" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;&nbsp; **FOR YOU** : If you can picture society working better, or if you can test ideas against evidence, you already qualify as a civic architect for CoCivium.  Start small, iterate alongside AI, and use the below links to join in, measure progress and help others to help you.

# Cognocarta Consenti (CC)
<img align="right" src="./assets/cc/cc-crest.svg" alt="Cognocarta Consenti crest" width="150">

**Mission:** Build the **living constitution for digital society**—borderless, people-first, and **directly evolvable by anyone who cares**.

**Project:** **CoCivium** is the open-source community that **writes, tests, and ships the CC**—plus the policies, processes, and tools that keep **hybrid life (physical + digital)** **democratic, equitable, and aligned** with human values.

> If you can read this page, you’re qualified to help. No coding or civics degree required.

## Why now (plain language)

- **Analog rules in a digital era.** Yesterday’s constitutions weren’t built for instant, global coordination.  
- **Platforms act like public squares—without public safeguards.** A few companies set the rules and recourse.  
- **Attention beats trust.** Outrage spreads; nuance stalls.  
- **Participation is hard.** Jargon and gatekeeping keep most people out.  
- **Good ideas die in threads.** We lack a clear path from **voice → draft → decision → action → accountability**.

**The CC’s promise:** a shared, evolvable framework that communities can adopt, adapt, and audit.

---

## What the CC is

- A **set of shared declarations** (promises, protocols, and rights) for how we listen, decide, and act—together.  
- A **practical playbook** (patterns, templates, guardrails) any community can reuse.  
- A **living document**: updated like good software—proposed, reviewed, improved **in the open**.

## From idea to impact (at a glance)

**voice → draft → review → decision → action → accountability**

Start with an [Idea](../../issues/new/choose) — or ask your AI to open one using our [RepoAccelerator](./admin/tools/repo-accelerator/README.md) *(placeholder)*. When ready, open a **post** (pull request). That’s it. The rest you’ll learn as you go.

*Details later:* see [Process Overview](./docs/process/OVERVIEW.md) *(placeholder)*.

**2 minutes — Say hi**  
Open **Issues → New** → title: “Hello CoCivium”. One line about what you care about—locally or online.  
*Or ask your AI to open it for you using our template.*

**10 minutes — Share an idea**  
Open an **Idea Issue** with a clear problem and a smallest useful change.  
*Ask your AI to generate it from a paragraph of notes.*

**30–60 minutes — Start a post (PR)**

## The “Two Eyes” model (citizen × system)

We design governance that sees with **two eyes**:
- **Eye 1: Citizens** — lived experience, local context, moral intuitions.  
- **Eye 2: Systems** — data, constraints, impact analysis, safety.

Together they give us **depth perception**—humane and workable decisions.
