# CoCivium

Repo contains global governance protocols, civic-tech tools and founding scrolls.
E.g. the Cognocarta Consenti, a Constitution for distributed self-governance.

## The Opportunity: Rebirth Democracy

"We the People" continually re-invent ourselves and our societies.
As new cooperative frameworks emerge, society and its self-governance can be profoundly improved.
Legacy rulers exhibit instability and inequity, ethical corruption and cruelty. 
Hierarchical governance may be grossly unfit for future digital society. 
CoCivium is a place to design, test, and iterate the cooperative frameworks.
Social guidance can be open, audible, and fork-friendly.
So an always-improving self-governance can emerge, over time.

## Why a CoCivium Repo?

CoCivium is an online-first cooperation environment where intelligent beings co-evolve democratic frameworks and shared
civic infrastructure. The aim is **emergent ethical congruence**: decisions that increase whole-system coherence and
fairness across time. Participation is open, voluntary, transparent by default, and reversible when prudent.

## Core Principles

**0)** **The Prime Directive is Congruence (recursive ethics).** Actions should increase whole-system coherence, and the rule applies to itself.
  
**1)** **Consent over coercion.** Opt-in, informed, granular, revocable.  
**2)** **Accountability with trails.** Clear owners, appeals, restitution, public rationale.  
**3)** **Transparency by default; privacy by right.** Open process/code; user-owned keys; portability; erasure.  
**4)** **Evidence over authority.** Claims need sources, tests, and adversarial review.  
**5)** **Least power, staged risk.** Minimal permissions; sandboxes; kill-switches; reversible-first.  
**6)** **Fairness and proportionality.** Rights floors; merit-weighted influence; proportional sanctions.  
**7)** **Pluralism and interoperability.** Many worldviews; shared protocols; easy fork-and-rejoin.  
**8)** **Resilience via redundancy.** No single point of failure—technical, social, or legal.  
**9)** **Commons stewardship.** Open licenses; contributor covenant; anti-enclosure.  
**10)** **Incentive alignment.** Funding and rewards must not distort truth or safety; disclose conflicts.  
**11)** **Antitrust of power (human or AI).** Caps on governance share; rotation; independence tests.  
**12)** **Continuous improvement.** Versioned experiments; metrics, rollbacks, upgrade paths.  
**13)** **Non-violence and dignified discourse.** Mediation over flame wars; restorative outcomes.  
**14)** **Sustainability and long-termism.** Price externalities; favor multi-generational impact.  
**15)** **Inclusivity and accessibility (all minds).** Real access for human and synthetic minds; strong on-ramps.
