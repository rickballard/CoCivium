**Subject:** Digital constitutionalism in practice — quick advisory request (CoCivium™)

Hi Edoardo Celeste — your work on digital constitutionalism has shaped our approach.
We are operationalizing due-process + appeals inside protocols (code + institutions, not just words). Could we book 30 minutes to sanity-check our Cognocarta Consenti (rights, remedies, jurisdiction-aware routing) and our anti-gaming metrics (congruence, remedy-rate, legitimacy signals)?
You'd directly influence the appeals module and a near-term pilot; timing is flexible.
Our specific ask here: 30-min advisory; check congruence with EU approaches.
