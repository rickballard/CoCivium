# CoCivium Paste 1

If you have wished the open-source community would aim its energy at
everyday governance, you might like CoCivium. CoCivium is a free
civic-tech framework and toolkit for consent-first governance, designed
for human-AI teams.

It couples a living CoConstitution with clear process specs and
explainable decision logs, so choices are traceable, reversible, and
portable across contexts.
