# CoCivium — “Paste 1”
If you’ve ever wished the open-source community would aim its superpowers at fixing everyday governance, you might like this. **CoCivium** is a free civic-tech framework for **consent-first governance**, designed for **human+AI teams** (“hybrid societies”).

It couples a living **CoConstitution** with explicit process specs and **explainable decision logs**, so choices are **traceable, reversible, and portable** across contexts.
